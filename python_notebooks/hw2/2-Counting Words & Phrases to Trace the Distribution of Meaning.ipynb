    "# Week 2 - Counting Words & Phrases (Computational Linguistics)\n",
    "This week, we take text corpora that we have developed, spidered, scraped, and encoded, and we find and count words, simple and parsed phrases and explore the statistical properties of those counts (e.g., word frequency distributions). Initially, we model how to search corpora for keywords or phrases. Next, we examine the distributions of terms and phrases across a corpus, and the correlation between different words and phrase counts. In order to do this effectively, we coarsely disambiguate words based of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and normalize them through stemming and lemmatization. Next we distinguish *important* words and phrase within the corpus, and image them with Wordls! Then we calculate word frequenceis, conditional frequences (the frequency of word *shock* conditional on the presence of word *awe*), and statistically significant collocations of lengths 2 through $n$. Finally, we calculate and visualize Differences (Divergences and Distances) between the word frequency distributions from two corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we shift to focus not simply on the *ideas* in a corpus, but also extracting precise *claims*. This process involves a sequential pipeline of classifying and structuring tokens from text, each of which generates potentially useful data for the content analyst. Steps in this process, which we examine in this notebook, include: 1) tagging words by their part of speech (POS) to reveal the linguistic role they play in the sentence (e.g., Verb, Noun, Adjective, etc.); 2) tagging words as named entities (NER) such as places or organizations; 3) structuring or \"parsing\" sentences into nested phrases that are local to, describe or depend on one another; and 4) extracting informational claims from those phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be introducing spaCy as a package for Computational Linguistics, and also walk you through how to use the Davies Corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we wish to avoid using NLTK for heavy corpus analysis, some of its smaller functions can still be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, for final projects that draw on these tools, we encourage you to install the software on your own machines or shared servers at the university (RCC, SSRC) in order to perform these operations on much more text.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook we will be using the following packages:\n"

At least he would n\\'t holler . He \\'s got a terrible temper . Well , you want to go over and try Edna \\'s house again ? No . If she was there , she \\'d open the door . She must be sleeping at her aunt\\'s . - Come on . - What are you gon na do ? I \\'m goin \\' up and tell your brother you were with me . No . You ca n\\'t go up . There \\'d only be a fight .

Jim come over to my house about an hour ago to see if you were there . He was worried about you , so I came back here with him . I , um - I could n\\'t remember the name of that hospital ... you said you were going to to visit that girl . She must be worse , huh ? Your staying there until almost 4:00 . You mean well , Edna , but that \\'s a lot of hooey . - Where were ya ? - Where do you think , Edna ? - I \\'m gon na get married . - No . So , it \\'s as bad as that , huh ? What do you mean it \\'s as bad as that ? I thought girls brought their fellas around and showed them off first to their families . They do in families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , not that you \\'d have brains enough to know it ... but I \\'ve been a pretty good brother to you , see ? I \\'ve been a father and a mother to ya .

You do n\\'t even know the fella . No , but I \\'m going to . Bring him around . Let him meet your family , like any decent fella would want to do . And after a while , if I think he \\'s all right ... you can marry him . - After a while ? - Oh , that gets a rise out of you , does it ? I thought it would . One of them rush marriages . - What do you mean ? - You know what I mean . - You do n\\'t know that I did anything wrong . - I can put two and two together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can prove that you \\'re not . You tell me that you \\'ll wait , or I \\'ll know that you got ta marry this guy . And if that \\'s the case , I do n\\'t want you in the house . - Now , what do you think about that ? - Where \\'ll I go ? Go back where you come from , you little tramp . And get out now . You wo n\\'t take any clothes with you either . I paid for every rag you got on your back . Go on . Get out . You deserve everything you \\'re gettin \\' . Sure does . A girl brought up under the influence of a fine brother like you got . You \\'ll probably end up in the streets . That \\'s what you got in your mind , ai n\\'t it , Jim ? And I wo n\\'t be sorry for her either . No , I do n\\'t expect you to be sorry for her , Jim . But let her have her clothes . - I paid for \\' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let her find out there ai n\\'t another man who \\'ll treat her as white as her own brother did . Go on . Let her have her clothes . All right . Get \\' em , and get out . Hey , Dot . Hey . - Where you goin \\' ? - With the kid , you big bully . You called her a tramp , did n\\'t ya ? Just because she stayed out until 4:00 in the morning and you suspect where she was . Well , I stayed out until 4:00 in the morning , and you knew where I was . So I got a pretty good idea what you think of me . I \\'ll see you in the cemetery . Go on , Dot . Wake up , Dotty . Wake up . Hello , Floyd . Ma just hollered across the air shaft ... and said that she was makin \\' breakfast for a new bride . Are you a new bride ? Yes , darling . I \\'m going to be today . - What \\'s an old one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Run along and play now . Aw , I wan na see Dotty get out of bed . You get out of here . I wan na see Dotty get out of bed . And at his age . - What time is it ? - Almost 11:00 . - I phoned the store and said we were both sick . - Has Eddie come yet ? - Nope . - He has n\\'t ? - Not yet . - I wonder why he does n\\'t come . - Maybe it \\'s \\' cause he does n\\'t know I \\'m here . - That \\'d be a good reason . He certainly would n\\'t come to see me . Oh , he does n\\'t really dislike you , Edna . No , not dislike . He hates me . And it is n\\'t just an average , everyday , amateur kind of hatred either . I \\'ll bet that guy spends hours practicing hating me . Aw , that \\'s just his way . You know , he \\'s kind of funny . That would be great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gee , Edna , it was swell the way you came through for me last night . - I \\'m awful grateful to ya . - And I \\'m grateful toJim . - He saved my life . - How ? Just suppose he did n\\'t turn out to be a heel last night . I \\'d have been married to him in three months , and after being nicely cemented ... with a wedding ring , the church service and everything ... I \\'d have found out what he really is . Yes , sir . He saved my life- \\' cause they send you to the chair these days for killing your husband . In the name of goodness , what are you doing ? - I \\'m trying something , but it wo n\\'t work . - What wo n\\'t ? I put some black ink in the white milk ... and the white milk turned black . But when I put the white milk in the black ink , the black wo n\\'t turn white . Put that ink away and clean up that mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what time Is It now ? It \\'s a little after 11:00 . - Where \\'d you put my stockings ? - Why , I put \\' em , uh-Is this Mrs . Cook \\'s boardinghouse ? Well , is Mr . Collins there ? Collins . Eddie Collins . He what ?

Schuyler 4-6583 . Schuyler 4-6583 . And hurry it up , deary . There \\'s a fire . Here . Hello ? Hello , Lathrop Radio Shop ? Well , can I speak to Mr . Collins , please ? Eddie Collins . Never mind the wisecracks . He \\'s there , I wan na speak to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Fresh guy trying to flirt with me . He what ? He was fired ? What for ? He said he was fired for robbin \\' the cash register . Well , you \\'re all right then . If he \\'s lost his job , it \\'s a cinch he \\'ll be here to marry ya . I ca n\\'t tell whether the fella was kiddin \\' or not . There he is now . See ? All of your troubles for nothing . Oh , gee , and I \\'m not dressed or anything . Oh , give me those stockings . I do n\\'t wan na subscribe to any magazines . I do n\\'t care if you \\'re working your way through the penitentiary . - Was that him , Edna ? - No . A book agent . Oh . What am I gon na do ? Now , stop worrying . If Eddie is only half the guy I think he is , he wo n\\'t let you down . That \\'s the trouble with us women . If we \\'d only realize that-Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - I \\'m cookin \\' it for ya . - A whole pound of butter . I told you a piece of butter , not a pound of butter . A pound \\'s a piece . I \\'ll go , Edna . Oh , darling , you \\'re driving me crazy . Get out into the hall . You \\'ve done all the damage in here that you can . See if you can ruin the wallpaper . - Shall I do it with a knife ? - Get out of here ! - Was n\\'t him , huh ? - No . A man selling-For goodness \\' sake , take that long face off . This is your wedding day , not your funeral . He \\'ll be here . There \\'s a mistake somewhere . That \\'s all . Yeah , last night- that was the mistake . Do n\\'t be silly . He \\'ll be here . Oh , but I love him so much . Well , you can still love him and have a cup of coffee in your stomach too . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything again . - Fine . Then have a glass of milk . - I do n\\'t want any milk . Oh , come on . Have a glass of milk . It \\'ll do you good . You know , the first thing that you have to learn is-I \\'m getting hysterical . Open the door , Floyd . And if it \\'s a man selling coffins , tell him we \\'ll take two . Who \\'s dead ? Oh , Eddie ! - What \\'s the matter ? - Nothing . Say , listen . You \\'re going to be a married man . The first thing you have to learn is to get accustomed to your wife \\'s tears . I was over to your house , and they said you was n\\'t there . So I took a chance and come here . I called up your house , and your landlady said that you \\'d moved . I got a bigger room across the street . My landlady was sore . That \\'s why she would n\\'t tell you where I went . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing . They were kidding \\' ya . Oh , Eddie , I \\'m so happy . - Okay . - Now maybe you can eat some breakfast . We \\'ll eat downtown . We got ta get goin \\' . Go get your things .

When you get out of the train , you walk straight ahead and turn to the right . There are two exits there . You take the one to the left . Understand ? - Yeah . - Then when you get up on the street ... - you walk straight ahead-- I \\'m gon na take a cab . I \\'ll tell you which cab to take . Hey . Whose wedding is this , yours or mine ? Oh , Edna \\'s just trying to help us , Eddie . You was n\\'t on the other side when they had the war , were ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was wondering how they ever got along without you . I phoned my orders over . Wo n\\'t you come down and see us get married ? No . I hate those things- deaths and funerals and things like that . Oh , gee , Edna . I can never thank you enough for all you \\'ve done for me . Oh , that \\'s all right , kid . I only hope you \\'re gon na be awful happy . If she ai n\\'t , you \\'ll hear from me , you big stiff . Okay . - Good luck . - So long . Good-bye . Oh , darling !

Aw , gee , it was sweet of you to bring me the candy . And I got news for ya . I found a store . The boss is gon na lend me a hundred bucks ... and with the 650 I got saved up , I can swing the deal . He \\'ll let me have all the radios I want on time . - What do you know about that , huh ? - That \\'ll be swell . Of course , we may have to pinch nickels for a while but ... in the end , it \\'ll all be jake . - Gee whiz , I \\'m a happy guy . - Are you , Eddie ? Yeah . I been thinkin \\' about having my own store for over two years now . And while I ai n\\'t much on tossing \\' this baloney ... and all that mush stuff ... a guy could have a worse wife than you . - Ya little squirt . - Oh , Eddie . - I love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hat and coat on , and I \\'ll take you over and show you the place . - Oh , I ca n\\'t now . - Why not ?

Oh , gee . It \\'ll be tough if she do n\\'t like it . Oh , Eddie , that \\'s not a nice thing to say . Here she is . Now , please do n\\'t be mean to her . Come in . - Hello , Dot . - HI , Edna . How \\'s the grouch ? I thought they sent you down to Washington ... so you could tell the president how to run the country . Ooh . They sent the president up to see me . Oh , do n\\'t mind him , Edna . - He \\'s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks it . - He \\'s gon na open his own store soon . - Hmm ! I heard Wanamaker \\'s were going out of business . They probably figured the competition would be too much for \\' em . I \\'m going down to the corner and get a paper . Come on . Sit down . I \\'ve got so much to tell you . - Still in love with him ? - Oh , I \\'m just crazy about him . Edna , I \\'m going to have a baby . Oh , Dot . - I \\'m afraid . - Oh , do n\\'t be silly . - My mother had eight of_\\'em . - Yeah . My mother died having me . Yes , but things are different now . You know , the hospitals are better , and the doctors and things . No girl minds it anymore . - What does Eddie say ? - He does n\\'t know . Well , why do n\\'t you tell him ? Well , his heart \\'s so set on having that store . It \\'ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n\\'t know what to do . Edna , I \\'m so worried . You know , if the store \\'s gon na make Eddie happy , I want him to have it . - Sure . - When I think of what happened to my mother-Unless I had everything of the best- you know , the best doctors and everything-- I \\'d be frightened . - You poor kid . Now listen . This fella you \\'re married to is all right . He \\'s 100 ? /o . I know what \\'s the matter with him . He \\'s one of those sensitive eggs . Of course , he may not like me , but what the heck . Napol ? on had a couple of enemies too . Now you tell Eddie tonight . And if I know anything about men ... he \\'ll be stopping strangers on the street tomorrow , bragging about it . - Do you really think so ? - Oh , sure . All men are alike . They puff themselves up . You \\'d think they \\'d done something . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - He will be . I do n\\'t know though . He \\'s always yelling about living in a tenement ... and what a sin it is to have children if you ca n\\'t afford to give \\' em everything . I do n\\'t think I read anything in the papers about him being born in the White House . He was awful poor . That \\'s why he thinks like that about it . Here he is . Do n\\'t say anything . - You still here ? - No . Dld you get your paper , Eddle ? I got down there , and I did n\\'t have any change . You can get one next week . They \\'ll have a dozen new murders for you by then . Here , let me fix that tie . - It looks like a unbent pretzel . - The tie is-You only wear it . Other people have to look at it . I do n\\'t know how you ever picked this jane out for a friend . - She \\'s the dizziest dame I ever seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eddie . Look what I got ! Look what I got ! - Where \\'d you get all this stuff ? - Eddie give us 60 cents to buy it . Aw , he \\'s crazy . It was - Sixty-Oh , what did you wan na come up here for anyway ? Go on outside and play . Go on . Go on . Go on now . Get out of here . Thanks a lot , Eddie ! Gim me a slice of that cone down there . Poor kids . I found \\' em downstairs in that dark hallway tryin \\' to play games . They ai n\\'t got a chance in life . Eddie , did you give him the 60 cents ? Listen , I got better things to do with my money ... than throw it away on a lot of kids . Say , you \\'re a swell egg . What are you gon na sell in your radio store ? Never mind . The way you run people \\'s business for them ... if you start butting \\' in , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I \\'m going . - Remember now . Tell him . - Tell him what ? Oh , nothing , Eddie . She \\'s got a secret for ya . Oh , she \\'s got a secret for me , but you know it . Geez , you \\'re runnin \\' my house for me , too , I see . - Sure . Bye , darlin \\' . - See you tomorrow . - Bye , grouch . - So long , dizzy . - What \\'s the big secret ? - I do n\\'t know whether you \\'ll like it or not . Hey , listen , kid . I \\'m so happy about the store , I \\'d like anything . Oh . Well ? What is it ? Eddie , I \\'m going back to work . - Back to work ? - Yeah . Hey , listen . No wife of mine is goin \\' to work . - What \\'d be the harm ? - I \\'ll do all the work that \\'s to be done in this family . - What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well-Well , it gets kind of lonesome staying \\' here all day all alone . Ca n\\'t you go to picture shows and things ? You just said we \\'d have to pinch nickels . Yeah , but I did n\\'t mean we \\'d have to pinch \\' em that hard . - You do n\\'t like livin \\' in just one room . Is that it ? - Oh , it \\'s all right . But I wish we had a flat of our own or something-you know , our own furniture . Ca n\\'t you see , Eddie ? If I went to work , you could have your store just the same . And with the money I make , we could-Do you think I \\'d take money you worked for ? - Oh , it \\'d be all right . - Not with me , it would n\\'t . My idea of a husband is a guy that looks after his wife and takes care of her ... and sees that she do n\\'t want for nothin \\' . If I ca n\\'t do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money- you work all day- or let you use it for something that I ought to be payin \\' for . Listen . They got a name for guys like that . Oh , Eddie , I did n\\'t mean to make you sore . I ai n\\'t sore . But I ai n\\'t as happy as I was . You can lay that on a line . It was our 10 weeks anniversary . And I had the store all picked out and everything . And , say , when I come in here tonight , I was walkin \\' on air . This kinda crumbs it all up . Gee , I did n\\'t know you was n\\'t satisfied . Oh , Eddie , I am satisfied . It \\'s all right . Let \\'s not talk about it . - I \\'ll bet that Edna jane put that idea in your nut . - No , she did n\\'t . Let \\'s not say any more about it . You \\'re crazy to have the store , and it \\'ll make you happy . Well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I \\'m the husband , and it \\'s my job to make you happy . If a husband ai n\\'t for that , he ai n\\'t for nothin \\' . Gee , I told the real estate guy I \\'d meet him tonight . I ca n\\'t make up my mind about that sign . \\' \\' Eddie Collins \" or \\' \\' Edward Collins \" ? Course , \\' \\' Eddie Collins \" is all right for a saloon or somethin \\' like that . Nope , it ai n\\'t got class enough for a radio store . I \\'ll be back in 15 or 20 minutes . And I still think that Edna jane put that idea in your nut . I was afraid you was n\\'t comin \\' . What \\'s the idea of phoning \\' me to meet you here ? - Dot and me are movin \\' here . - You \\'re movin \\' here ? Sure . I got new furniture and everything . That \\'s why I asked you to come . I thought maybe you \\'d help me put \\' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anyway , so I figured out you might as well do it in the beginning . You \\'re moving here ? Yeah . Dot told me that secret . What \\'s that got to do with your moving and spending your money ? She wanted to go to work . - You mean that \\'s the secret she told you ? - Yeah . So I put two and two together and figured out why . She wanted a home with nice furnishings and things . - Say , how much did all this cost you ? - I shot the bankroll . - Oh , no . - Yeah . - All you \\'d saved ? - Sure . This is a swell joint . The furniture man is takin \\' charge . I bought everything new- from soup to nuts . When it \\'s finished , it \\'ll look just like a home that somebody \\'s lived in for a long time . Some surprise for the kid , huh ? Yeah , but what about your store ? Well , I figured , why let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build up a business ? I might \\'ve made a flop of the store anyhow . Not that I would \\'ve . I \\'d have made a success of it . Do n\\'t get that idea in your nut . And you spent all your savings ? Sure . She \\'s worth it . She \\'s a great kid . You \\'ll have me crying in a minute , Eddie . What for ? You would n\\'t know . Come on . You never saw anything sweller than that parlor set I bought . Come on . Wait till you get a load of the bedroom . It \\'s got sheets and pillowcases and beds and everything in it . And the kitchen- We got a lot of pots and pans . It \\'s gon na be like a party . See , I \\'m gon na tell Dot that Pat and Sue have got a new flat ... and are havin \\' a housewarming and we \\'re invited . I asked a lot of the gang , and they \\'re in on it too . It \\'s gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties . And the big payoff comes when I say ... \\' \\' Well , kid , how do you like your new home ? \" What do you think of the idea ? - I do n\\'t know . - You did n\\'t think it up . That \\'s why . Hey , wait a minute . Do n\\'t put that great big chair over there by the divan . - That \\'s where the chair belongs . - No , it is n\\'t . It belongs over on this side . Have n\\'t you got any sense of balance ? - You would get your mouth in it some way or another . dd Hey , hey . Wait until they get here . Aw , have a heart . I have n\\'t had any supper . And do n\\'t drink up all the punch . Here they are . Listen , Pat . Remember , this is supposed to be your home . You \\'re the host . - Right . I \\'ll take off my coat and collar . - That ai n\\'t funny . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Go on . I did n\\'t even know that Pat had moved from 92nd Street . Sure . They got a swell place here . - Hello , Dot . How are you ? - Hello , Sue . - Hello , Eddie . - I did n\\'t know that you \\'d moved . Oh , I \\'ve been here a week . Come in . Hi , everybody . - Hello , Chad . How are you ? - Hello , Dot . - Hello , Pat . How are you ? - Let me take your coat . - Have a schnapps . - Oh , no , thanks . Oh , gee , Sue , this is swell . Pat must have murdered a millionaire or something . Hey , you ai n\\'t seen nothin \\' yet . Come on out here and I \\'ll show you the kitchen . You \\'d think this was his house . Come on . Let \\'s eat . A closet , and it \\'s got glass in it too . And a sink and a washtub . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you keep your salt and pepper and spices and things . In the one marked \\' \\' Salt , \" you keep the salt . In the one marked \\' \\' Pepper , \" you keep the pepper . Gee , Eddie , ai n\\'t it swell ? Look at that darling table . The guy said it was the breakfast nook . Oh , Eddie , you think we \\'ll ever have a place like this ? - Would you like to live here , kid ? - Oh , gee , would I ? - Of course , we could n\\'t afford-- Why not ? Well , we could n\\'t afford the money now . Well , why now ? - Well , you wan na get your store first . - Yeah . Oh , yeah . That \\'s right . Say , wait till you get a load of the bedroom . Come on ! Say , if Eddie can get Dot a home like this , why ca n\\'t you get me one ? I thought that \\'d crop up . - Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kid . There \\'s a bed . You ca n\\'t buy a better bed than that- 65 bucks . - But how did you-- Oh , Pat told me . Come on . Feel it . Just feel it . Ai n\\'t this a bed ? Not like that old egg crate we sleep in . I \\'ve never seen you so enthusiastic . The house has sure made a hit with you . Come on . Now I \\'m gon na show you somethin \\' . Just grand . There \\'s the bridges over there . And there \\'s all New York to pick from . Ai n\\'t the lights great ? And the East River . And stars . Are n\\'t they beautiful ? Not phony one\\'s either . Gee , a roof like this would be a swell place for ... kids to play . Would n\\'t it , Eddie ? You know , they could get plenty of fresh air ... and their mothers would n\\'t have to worry about streetcars ... and taxis and trucks and things . You know , rich kids could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , do n\\'t you , kid ? Oh , I think it \\'s just grand . I \\'m awful glad for Pat and Sue . Okay . We better get back to the bunch now . You said it . Sue , it \\'s the grandest flat I ever saw . - I \\'m awfully glad you like it , Dot . - Oh , it \\'s sweet for anything . Dot , sit down . Here goes . Well , kid , it \\'s yours . - Mine ? What do you mean , mine ? - Sure . Yours . This is where you \\'re gon na live . I bought it for you . - You bought it for me ? - Sure . You know that secret about goin \\' back to work ? Well , I doped it out that you was n\\'t satisfied where you \\'re livin \\' . So this is the answer . - Well , what about your store ? - Thls Is It . You spent all your money for this ? I shot the works . - You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t owe a nickel on It . Well , what do ya say ? I do n\\'t know . Do n\\'t seem to make such a hit with ya now . Naturally , Eddie . She \\'s surprised . You ca n\\'t get a thing like this through your head in a minute . - Did you know he was doing it , Edna ? - Yeah , I helped him fi ? x It up . Why \\'d you let him spend all the money ? Well , folks , it looks like a bust . Oh , no , it is n\\'t , Eddie . I think it \\'s just great . I \\'m tickled to death . - You \\'re the swellest husband any girl ever had . - Okay . Dot \\'s only disappointed for you , Eddie . She was so anxious for you to have the store ... she did n\\'t want you to spend the money for anything else . - That \\'s right . - Sure . That \\'s why , dear . You know I think it \\'s just swell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a long time dead . Live while ya can . That \\'s what I say . When I think of the way my folks used to live . They did n\\'t have enough money to support themselves ... so they go and have nine kids . My old lady used to scrub floors in an office building . 4:00 every morning she went to work- sick or well , summer or winter . I can see her goin\\'out when It was 20 below zero ... with a cough that \\'d tear the heart out of ya . And for what ? To bring up a couple ofklds and die- dle before they was ever any comfort to her . Not for Dot . Every nickel I make , she and I are gon na spend on ourselves . - My sister died bringing up-- Oh , stop it ! Ca n\\'t you stop it ! You \\'d think there was nothin \\' else in the world to talk about . All right . There , there , dear . Shh . What \\'s wrong ? Dot \\'s going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eddle . No , she \\'s just a little hysterical . That \\'s all . We should n\\'t have talked about those things . - That \\'s right . I guess we shouldn\\'t . - Sue told me , but I forgot . Gee , everybody in New York seems to know about it ... but the only guy that \\'s interested . Oh , gee , Eddie , I wish you \\'d let me do that . Do n\\'t be crazy , will ya ? You \\'re goin \\' to the hospital in a few weeks . You know the doc told you not to do any hard work . I do n\\'t think he knows what he \\'s talkin \\' about . I do n\\'t like him . - You want me to get you a different one ? - No . If you ca n\\'t get the best , he \\'s as good as any of the others , I guess . He \\'s all right . I worry . That \\'s all . - About what ? - About everything . You having to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pinching \\' every nickel the way you have . I do n\\'t want a baby any more than you do . All right , all right . Now you told me that a thousand times . Let \\'s not talk about it . Is there any other doctor you got in mind ? There was somethin \\' in the paper about a society woman . The doctor \\'s name was Burgess . His picture was there . Gee , he was awful kind-lookin \\' . Not that we could get him . He \\'s only for millionaires . As long as you ca n\\'t get him , you might as well pick out the best . Whoo-ooh ! Dot ! Now do n\\'t bring her in here . I do n\\'t want her razzin \\' me . - Good morning . - Hello , Edna . - Hello , Eddie . - So long . Floyd made such a racket , I did n\\'t wait for breakfast . - Got a cup of coffee ? - Sure . Hmm . You got a new washerwoman , I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t got enough bluing in this water . I knew somethin \\' would be wrong with it when you seen it . - Here . - Thanks . Got a cigarette ? No , I cut \\' em out . They was puttin \\' my throat on the bum . Come on , Edna . Drink this in the other room . Yeah , go on . Beat it , will ya ? You give me the willies . That \\'s good . - How do you feel ? - Oh , all right . - How do you feel when you feel bad ? - I worry . Yeah , and you worry other people too . You worry him . Your child \\'ll probably grow up to be a radio broadcaster . Gee , It \\'s 10 minutes to 8 . ? 00 . I got ta blow . Do n\\'t touch those things . I \\'ll finish \\' em when I come home . - Good-bye , darling . - So long . - So long , meddlesome . - Good-bye , grouch . Break a leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so miserable . - What ? - He \\'s so square about everything . Says smoking hurts his throat . He cut it out so he could save the money . It does n\\'t seem fair that he should give up all his fun just because of me . Yeah , it \\'s tough on husbands . Nobody knows what a husband suffers when his wife has a baby ... and a big juicy raspberry . It must be great for a woman when everything is right- you know , when she can afford a doctor like that man Burgess ... and when she knows her husband wants the baby . You want it , do n\\'t you , Dot ? I \\'m crazy about it . That is , I would be ... if it were n\\'t for Eddie and if I was n\\'t afraid . - How do you know he does n\\'t want it ? - The things he says . I can feel it , too , in the way he acts . He does n\\'t like children . Coochie-coo . Coochie-coo . Coochie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? - Only seven months . Of course , all parents are proud of their children . But honestly , even if this was somebody else \\'s kid ... I \\'d have to admit it \\'s the cleverest youngster I ever saw . - Do n\\'t you think so , Mama ? - I honestly do . Hey , lookit ! The little son of a gun \\'s got ahold of my finger . That \\'s what I mean . Is n\\'t that clever ? - She \\'s a darling . Look at her . - Coochie-coo . Coochie-coo . Coochie , coochie-coo . Coochie-coo . Coochie-coo . Hey , Eddie . Eddie . Eddie . - Has Mr . Randall \\'s set been fixed for him ? - Yes , sir . - Gee , that \\'s a great kid you got . - We think so . - Say , Mr . Lathrop ? - Yes ? Do you think that a woman havin \\' a baby ... you know , that she has n\\'t always wanted ... could-could learn to love it ... you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your wife , eh ? She \\'s afraid . Say , there ai n\\'t any danger in these things , is there ? Well , lots of women manage to have babies ... without calling out the militia . There \\'s no danger when they have the proper attention . She should be made to have confidence in her doctor . That \\'s just it . My wife ai n\\'t got any . That \\'s not right . - She speaks of a Dr . Burgess . - Burgess ? You \\'d have to be a millionaire to have him . - Goin \\' to lunch , Eddie ? - Nah , I cut lunches out . I was gettin \\' too fat . - This Dr . Burgess is good , huh ? - And expensive . When a king is born , they send for him . I wonder how you could get in to see a guy like that . - Mr . Lathrop , will you take a look at this set , please ? - Oh , yes . Certainly . Hey , Joe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club ? - Yeah . Do you suppose he could get me on in one of them preliminary fights ? Say , some of those boys are pretty good . - What do you wan na take a beatin \\' for ? - Ten bucks a round . Four rounds- 40 bucks . I can use that dough swell . - I can fix it for ya , but I think you \\'re nutty . - Okay . 7:00 . Say , ai n\\'t that job of yours got any hours ? A guy wanted his radio fixed , so I did it on the side . I should think you \\'d try gettin \\' home ... with your wife goin \\' to the hospital and everything . - How is she ? - She \\'s worrying herself sick . That \\'s how she is . But , gee , she ought n\\'t to do that . I do n\\'t think she knows that . You ought to tell her . - You had any supper ? - I ai n\\'t hungry . Gettin \\' your beauty sleep , kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hurt you to hang around once in a while . Okay . That \\' \\' okay \" does me a lot of good , do n\\'t it ? Gee , kid , you know I \\'m for you , do n\\'t ya ? Well , it do n\\'t look like it . You have n\\'t spent an evening in the house for two weeks now . I do n\\'t mean to be a grouch , Eddie , but ... I \\'m frightened . Is it the doctor ? Is that what makes you afraid ? Oh , he \\'s all right , I guess . It \\'s my fault . You know , you have confidence in some people , and others you have n\\'t . There \\'s no reason . You just have . That \\'s all . Sure , I know how it is , kid . Eddie , you \\'re gon na stick around and go to the hospital with me tonight , ai n\\'t ya ? You betcha . No . Wait a minute . - I tell ya , I got ta go out-- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Oh , no . Just for a half an hour , kid . - Ca n\\'t even stay with me tonight . I \\'ll be right back . Honest I will . Mmm . Your honey is searching among the \\' \\' bees . \" Hello ? Yeah , this is his secretary . Mm-hmm . Who wants to talk to him ? Joe ? - There \\'s a Joe wants to talk to you . - Hello , Joe . Tonight ? Sure I \\'ll be there . Hey , that \\'s great . It comes just at the right time . Thanks . So long . I \\'ll be a little longer now , but I \\'ll be back at 9:00 . I got another fella to see now . - You pick a swell night to make a date . - You sure do . This ai n\\'t a date . Honest it ain\\'t . - I \\'ll be back as quick as I can . - Give my love toJenny , will ya ? - WhatJenny ? - WhateverJenny happens to be there . Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital . But I \\'m sure the doctor you have is competent . It ai n\\'t that . You see , she \\'s just a kid herself , and she \\'s frightened . Her mother died that way . She read about you In the paper , Dr . Burgess . Well , of course , we never thought we could get ya . She was sayin\\'that It would be swell ... If she could get a guy like you to be with her . Did you tell her you were coming to see me ? No , sir . She and me ai n\\'t been gettin \\' along very well lately . I \\'ve been workin \\' nights . I did n\\'t tell her about it . She thinks I \\'ve been chiseling \\' on her , I guess . I ca n\\'t tell things like that . I \\'m kind of a mug that way . Of course , I could n\\'t pay you what you \\'re worth . But I tell ya . I make 45 bucks a week , and pick up 15 workin \\' nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight tonight . And I got 381 saved up , see ? - Are you a prizefighter ? - No , sir . But a friend of mine \\'s gettin \\' me on ... in the preliminaries over at the Empire Club . I get 10 bucks a round , and I do n\\'t mind takin \\' a beating for 40 bucks . Llsten , Dr . Burgess-I always been kinda proud , see ? You know , pay my own way , take nothin \\' from nobody . But I ai n\\'t that way now , Doc . I \\'m beggin \\' you . If she knew she was gon na have you with her ... everything would be all right . But as it is ... she \\'s so sick from worry-I \\'m afraid maybe she \\'ll die . Will you do it , Doc ? I \\'ll give you the $381 I got saved up ... and I \\'ll pay you back dollar for dollar . Please do it , will ya , Doc ? So help me , God , I\\'ll- I \\'ll lay down my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks . - I guess I \\'m kinda nervous about this child thing . - Mm-hmm . Kinda goofy , huh ? Gee , Doc , I \\'m sorry I have n\\'t got a cigar or somethin \\' to offer ya . I cut out smokin \\' . It was hurtin \\' my throat . This is a swell dump you got here . Oh , I did n\\'t mean-Okay . Flght ! - He said 9:00 . - Do n\\'t worry . You \\'d think the least he could do would be to be with me tonight . Now , now , now . Do n\\'t get yourself all worked up . One , two-Get out . Get out . Hey , Mike , knock that fella out , will ya ? This ai n\\'t a slaughterhouse . I wanted to give him a break , but I \\'ll put him away right at the next gong . Aw , why do n\\'t ya quit ? I know what I \\'m doin \\' . I would n\\'t take a beatin \\' like that for a hundred bucks . Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . One , two , three , four ... five , six ... seven , eight , nine-Uh ! Do n\\'t knock me out , will ya , buddy ? I need the cash . - My wife \\'s gon na have a kid . - Well , why did n\\'t you tell me ? I guess I ca n\\'t make it though . Hold on to me . Take a deep breath . Break it up . Thanks . Good-bye . I \\'ve arranged for the hospital . The cab will be here at 11:00 . I never thought Eddie would do this to me . But , darling , he \\'s only an hour late . Some hours are lifetimes . He \\'s walked out on me . - When \\'s the kid expected ? - Any-Anytime now . - I got two of them . - Yeah ? How long before they get to know ya ? Mine knew me inside of two months . - But of course , mine was kinda extra bright . - Yeah . Oh , gee , kid , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad about you . - I could n\\'t help it . Could n\\'t spend a couple of minutes with me , tonight of all nights ? You know how nervous I am . But you could go to some speakeasy with a bunch of fellas ... and get your face all battered up in a drunken brawl . Is that what ya think ? That \\'s what it looks like to me . Okay . Do you want me to go with ya ? You do n\\'t have to bother about me anymore at all , Eddie . I got Burgess for ya ! - How about it , Doctor ? - Congratulations . Twins . - Twins ? - Twins . - Boys or girls ? - Both . - Twins ! - Yes , sir . The baby business is picking up . Sometimes I was here , and I was the only one . - This your first ? - Yes , and my last . I would n\\'t go through this again for all the money in the world . How many kids have you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t know . You do n\\'t know ? I know I got six . What \\'s happening upstairs , I ca n\\'t tell ya . Here I am . You \\'re the father of a fine baby girl , Mr . Vernon . - Oh , well . - Oh ! - Put him over here on the-- It was too much for him . - He \\'ll be all right . - What \\'s the matter with him ? - I \\'ve got some smelling salts . - That \\'s fine . Give him some . - He \\'ll be all right . - He \\'s as white as a sheet . He \\'ll be all right in a minute . People kid about fathers , but they do n\\'t realize ... what a guy has to go through when his wife has a baby . If he had as many as I got , he \\'d stay unconscious . He \\'s coming to now . He \\'s fine . - What happened ? - You just had a baby . I would n\\'t go through this again for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or he \\'ll faint again . - It \\'s all right , Mr . Vernon . You come with me . - Hold him up . - Gee , I \\'m gettin \\' nervous myself now . Do n\\'t be nervous . Say , Mr . Linsky , I wan na ask you a question . My wife was n\\'t any too anxious to- to have this kid . Say , in two weeks , she will be crazy about it . - Is that straight ? - They always are . Be careful . Do n\\'t let her think that you are more concerned for the baby ... than what you are for her . Women get jealous under those conditions . You know , be interested , but not anxious . After all , you \\'ve known your wife for years ... and the baby is practically a stranger . Yeah , that \\'s right . Excuse me . I got ta phone my partner . Mr . Collins ? - Yeah ? - A boy . Okay . Your wife will see you in just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know about that ? My kid \\'s 22 hours old already . They get old very quickly when they \\'re young . - Hello , Doctor . How are they ? - Fine . Say , Doc , I \\'ve got 350 bucks here . - And I \\'ll give ya-- Yeah , well , I have your bill here . Now , I have another patient . I must hurry . - Good luck to you , my lad . - Thanks . Gee , he \\'ll never let me speak to him about money . It says paid in full . And here \\'s a check . \\' \\' Pay to the order of Mr . Edward Collins \\'s son- $50 . \" What does that mean ? He \\'s giving your boy $50 to start a bank account . And he would n\\'t let me give him anything . Gee . That \\'s a guy for ya , ai n\\'t it ? Oh , they \\'re just grand , Mrs . Linsky . Every time I have a baby , my husband gives me a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t have any more room . - What do you think of it ? - Oh . Oh , no , this is n\\'t yours . This baby \\'s six days old . She acts like she hates the child . I guess maybe she did n\\'t want it . Do parents hate children they do n\\'t want ? I heard of people like that . How do you like this one ? - Oh , it \\'s darling . - Oh , no . This is young Mussolini . dd Gee , it \\'s funny when you think of it , ai n\\'t it ? Everybody in the world was once just a little bundle like that . - Is n\\'t this one cute ? - Oh , it \\'s lovely . Just look at those little hands . Did you ever see such an adorable nose ? Gee , it \\'s swell . Do n\\'t you want to hold your baby ? Is this mine ? - Honest ? Oh . - Thls Is It . I would n\\'t cry over It , Mrs . Colllns . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No ? Well , it \\'s the first time this baby was ever born . You can come in now . Hello , kid . - How do you feel ? - All right . Thanks for sending me the flowers . Okay . - Is that it ? - Yes , that \\'s it , and it \\'s no \\' \\' it . \" Well , I did n\\'t mean it that way . Let \\'s not talk about it . - That suits me too , kid . - I thought it would . We \\'ll take him back to the nursery now . I asked Dr . Burgess how we happened to get a fine doctor like him . He just laughed and said that you \\'d tell me . Oh , my boss knew him . He did it for him . - He give me a check for the baby \\'s bank too . - He did ? - Was n\\'t that swell of him ? - Yeah . Those big guys do a lot of work for charity . So you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-Well - Gee , everything I say seems to be wrong . Oh , Eddie . I \\'d give anything if- well , if things were different . Aw , everything \\'s gon na be all right , kid . We ai n\\'t gon na stop living just because we got a baby . You and me is gon na have a good time , the same as always . Why , In six months we \\'ll have forgotten we got a kid . Please go now . I \\'m tired . Sure . - When \\'ll you be home ? - In about two weeks . Well , hurry it up . I \\'ll feel like stepping \\' out a bit . - So long , kid . - So long . I \\'ll be back every day . Oh , Mrs . Linsky , she \\'s getting bigger every day . What are you going to call her ? I \\'m calling her Shelly , after my mother-in-law . Her name was Esther , but it \\'s close enough . Well , how are all the mothers today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the cab downstairs ? - Yes . Are you ready ? Mm-hmm . - Are you leaving now ? - Yes . But I heard you tell your husband that you were going tomorrow . - I want to surprise him . - Oh . Say , listen , kid . - Have you thought this thing over ? - Yep . I could n\\'t live with a man that did n\\'t like his own child . All he thinks about is stepping out . I could n\\'t go back to Eddie for anything . I \\'d get to hate him . Well , it \\'s your funeral , kid . Well , what are you going to do with that ? Well , I thought maybe the kid would like to fool around with it . What ? A two-weeks-old baby ? Well , it \\'s only a little balloon . The doctor \\'s in the ward . You \\'ll have to wait a few minutes . - Dr . Gibson ? - Yes ? Just a minute , please . - Hurry , Nurse Parson . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My baby . Something \\'s happened to my baby ! Somethlng \\'s happening to my baby . No , Mrs . Collins . It \\'s all right . - I want my baby ! I want my baby ! - He \\'s all right . - I want my baby ! - Please listen . I want my baby ! I want my baby ! I want my baby ! - I want my baby ! - What \\'s the matter , kid ? - Something \\'s happened to my baby . - Where ? In there ! It \\'s not your baby . There \\'s no danger . Your husband will get it . Now , everything is all right . - It \\'s all right . - He \\'s all right , kid . Look . Here he is . - He \\'s all right . - It was Mrs . Burns \\'s baby . Nothing serious . Just a little coughing spell . Oh , gee , kid . I did n\\'t know you liked it . And I thought all along that you did n\\'t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your nut . The things you said that night in the flat- you know , about your mother and everything . Well , I thought like that then . But gee , it \\'s different when you got your own kid . Hey , lookit .

You might have the future president of the United States in this cab . That \\'s what they all say . - Oh , yeah ? - Oh , Eddie . Now do n\\'t , Eddie . Hey . Let me hold him , will ya ? - You really want to , Eddie ? - Sure . Be careful . Put your arm under his head . - Okay . - There you go , baby . Say , Dr . Burgess was right about the kid \\'s head .

    "This shows that likelihood of a word occurring is inversely proportional to its rank. This effect is called [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law), and suggests that the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc. Zipf's law is most easily observed by plotting the data on a log-log graph, with the axes being log (rank order) and log (frequency) resulting in a linear relationship."

      "   Whitehouse met Lila two weeks ago. She was diagnosed two years ago with osteosarcoma, a cancerous bone condition, and last year underwent cadaver bone transplant surgery. The procedure saved her leg and is helping her remain cancer-free, but the transplanted tissue will not grow with her and likely will break down over time. Stem cell research, Whitehouse explained, could vastly improve the care of patients like Lila by allowing surgeons to enhance transplants with a patient's own stem cells, which could replace the lost bone and cartilage, or grow entirely new replacement bones and joints. \n",

    "As we want to start comparing the different releases we may choose to do a bit of filtering and normalizing that will allow us to focus on what we most care about. We can first make all of the words lower case, then drop the non-word tokens. Next, we can remove some 'stop words', stem the remaining words to remove suffixes, prefixes and (in some languages) infixes, or lemmatize tokens by intelligently grouping inflected or variant forms of the same word (e.g., with a stemmer and a dictionary).\n",

Another possible way of finding the roots of words is using NLTK's porting or stemming functionalities, but we will not be getting into them.\n",

For starters, we will use word lengths as the conditions, but tags or clusters will provide more useful results."

Explore whether these collocations are idiomatic and so irreducible to the semantic sum of their component words. You can do this by examination of conditional frequencies (e.g., what else is 'united' besides the 'United States'). If these phrases are idiomatic, what do they suggest about the culture of the world producing them?\n",

      "what can i say about myself? i enjoying helping people. i'm a good listener. i'm understanding and nonjudgmental. i am extremely motivated to learn and understand everything i can.  i've been told i have a good sense of humor and i tend to dominate the mood of people around me. i'm honest, i'm open, i'm straightforward, i enjoy independence but i am not afraid of showing intimacy. i also enjoy working out, and i am also a decent cook. if you want to know anything, just ask and chances are i'll tell you.  i thought this one personality test had an amusing description for me:  of all the types, you have to be one of the hardest to find fault in. you have a selfless and caring nature. you're a good listener and someone who wants to avoid conflict. you genuinely desire to do good. of course, these all add up to an incredibly overpowered conscience which makes you feel guilty and responsible when anything goes wrong. though you're constantly on a mission to find the truth, you have no use for hard facts and logic, which is a source of great confusion for those of us with brains. despite this, in a losing argument, you're not above spouting off inaccurate fact after fact in an effort to protect your precious values. you're most probably a perfectionist, which in this case, is a bad thing. i've reached a crossroads in my life at the moment. i am waiting for the opportunity to get on track and continue moving forward. until then i am living as best i can, doing what i enjoy, and spending a whole lot of time doing it. i'm really good at listening and understanding. i'm good at making people feel comfortable and opening up about things they normally don't talk about. i'm just one of those people that makes you feel like everything will be alright. i'm also very good at lightening moods, adding humor to most situations, and coming to conclusions based on the smallest amounts of data. there are three things people have told me they have noticed about me right off the bat. the first is my size, i am a tall guy and well rounded to be sure. the second is my personality. i am loud and boisterous. i have been told i can be a bit intimidating until you get to know me. and third is the fact that i am always laughing. no matter when or where, you can bet that i will be amusing myself with something. honestly, i don't do very much in the way of reading as anyone who knows me will tell you. it just moves too slowly to keep me interested. there are exceptions of course, but in general if i have a choice between reading a book or...anything else, i'll probably take anything else.  i don't watch as many movies as i used to but some of my favorites would be nightmare before christmas, saving private ryan, all star wars movies, lord of the rings...basically i like anything that has war in it. historical or fiction. i enjoy a lot of classic and animated movies. as long as i know what i'm getting, i'll probably be ok with it.  typically i only watch tv when i'm sick, otherwise i'm usually focused on other things. when i do watch tv though i enjoy watching shows like house, or ncis. i do enjoy certain cartoons or cooking shows as well.  when it comes to music, i haven't found anything yet that i don't enjoy. some favorites though would be jazz, classic rock, blues, and metal.  as for food i enjoy italian, mexican, chinese and japanese. pasta would definitely be my favorite. something to drink(i'm always thirsty) my phone my computer my music my games my hands(i'm very attached to them) i think about the future, the present, the past. i think about life and love. and i think about ways i can better myself and make my life more complete. on a typical friday night i am doing what i am doing right now, playing games, talking with friends. or sometimes i will be out with friends, having fun and being loud and obnoxious. i tend not to keep secrets. if you want to know, just ask. but i suppose if i had to put something, growing up i had the most sensational fear of sharks. but i took that fear, confronted it, understood it, and now sharks are my favorite animal. you should message me if you are looking to hook up with someone who is independent, but also dependable. or if you need someone to talk to who won't judge you. or if you're just looking for someone fun.\n",

      "life is at it's best when you're laughing with friends. i try to organize as many fun things to fill my time with as possible. i'm scottish, although i was born in singapore and have lived in california long enough now that most people can't tell i'm from anywhere other than the bay area. winter months are for skiing, and the rest are for camping, bbqing, hiking, concert going, wine tasting, and other assorted enjoyable activity's. when it comes to planning trips and making things happen, i'm a man of action. i like to think of myself as a nice guy, trying hard not to finish last. i worked as a sales manager at a .com for what was supposed to be a year or two but of course inevitably turned into five. on the plus side: it made me realize i didn't want to spend the next 40 years sitting behind a desk, so i switched my major from business to viticulture & oenology, aka, wine making. so for now, school's my job. after working all those years i've got to admit, i'm kinda loving it. i love to cook! anything & everything! french bread, fresh pasta, indian, french, german, latin, and anything else i can think of. i can't follow a recipe without putting my own twist in. i like big flavors! ... and caramelized onions.  i also brew my own beer, make my own red wine vinegar, and as soon as i get everything in order would love to start meddling with distillation (home made absinthe anyone)?  i also throw a pub crawl every year. this will be year 6. and each year is bigger & busier than the last. so i guess i'm really good at throwing really fun pub crawls. i'd like to think my sense of humor but i guess my eyes/girly long eyelashes should get an honorable mention too. if i were to include all of these, it would be a very very long list. so here are some highlights:  books - devil in the white city, anything by bernard cornwell or patrick o'brien, endurance, into thin air, a very good year, the hobbit, and yes: i read the harry potter books.  movies - braveheart (go figure), short circuit, planes trains & automobiles, forrest gump.  shows - dexter, sons of anarchy, entourage, true blood, the big bang theory.  music - almost anything, but favorites: green day, bad religion, incubus, radiohead.  food - anything good. or served as a sandwich. friends & family my iphone! my laptop/the internet coffee & diet coke bread garlic my future, and what i need to do to get it to turn out like i hope it will. out and about! friday is a great happy hour, dinner, & drinks day. although lately i've been stuck in traffic on the way to tahoe... sometimes i have a major fear of public speaking, and other times i don't. i can't explain it. you are fun and adventurous, like to laugh, and able to hold up your end of an interesting, intelligent, and entertaining conversation!\n",

      "i'm an australian/singaporean who grew up largely in california, studied in sweden, went to teach english in china, grad school in boston, then floated all around germany for a couple years on a random fellowship before coming back here (boston+s.f.bay -- i live partially in both cities) to start a company making mobile games to teach foreign languages.  an experimenter/tinkerer at heart, i love always creating and learning new things  from poi dancing to linguistic structures. on the one hand, i tend to take life seriously and stay focused on always working to accomplish all that i'm capable of. on the other, i like being able to just enjoy whatever comes in life. i guess, here's how one of my best friends once described me:  \"ravi...what can i say? he is full of contradictions! he hates school and yet, he conquered the two top schools in the country. he likes solitude and yet he has a million of friends. he is a computer geek who loves the poetry of gibran. he is, for sure, the best travel partner ever!\" so, growing up, a lot of my friends were involved with the united nations and international affairs. with that, i developed a huge appreciation for the importance of working to further international justice and human affairs. at the same time, though, i watched how helpless they always felt and jaded many of them became as they entered the political realm, so i wanted to work in other areas of global/cultural awareness.  throughout high school i was exceptionally bad at learning foreign languages (drop me in mexico at the time, i'd never be able to find a bathroom). though, i noticed that even the good students weren't really learning to speak a second language at any acceptable rate. for undergrad i wanted to explore different ways of improving foreign language learning, so i studied linguistics, cognitive neuroscience and teaching [english]. i found video games actually made the perfect medium for teaching lots of concepts like foreign languages, so in grad school i focused specifically on video games studies.  i think due to historical reasons, video game designs thus far have been extremely circumscribed. but, as a medium it's basically this nexus for the most talented artists across all modalities of expression to come together: visual artists, composers/sound designers, script writers, interaction designers, programmers, choreographers (with systems like the kinect), etc. and you get to work with all of them, giving them a medium where they can all collaborate and try to harmonize together  which is a really beautiful experience with incredible possibilities, i think.  after graduating i stayed on with a research lab called the mit education arcade to develop video games to teach mathematics and logical thinking to jr. high students. and now i'm finally starting my own company to make [cell-phone] video games for teaching foreign languages =)  in terms of relationships, growing up my best friends were actually mostly older/married and all of social life just kinda had a really different rhythm to it from the typical teens'n'20's dating scene. to me, being in a relationship just never seemed genuine when i knew i was nowhere near ready for something that could lead to marriage. at least now i've somewhat settled down from my crazy scrambling to learn all the various pieces for reconceptualizing the ways people learn foreign languages. also i've somewhat satisfied my peripatetic side (though i'm still open to more travel for sure!) and am more likely to spend time exploring the cities i live in rather than spontaneously taking off to a random chinese village or hiking around the arctic circle again. update: apparently i lied when i wrote that. i'll be living in san francisco, berlin/dublin, tasmania over the coming months and am still deciding where to live after that (i can work from anywhere now). -most things digital/conceptual (as opposed to, say, origami -- as much as i like it). -listening, from what i've been told (as opposed to having to come up with random schmoozing) -typing really really fast (as opposed to writing anything at all succinct) -coming up with interesting ways of learning things -staying self-motivated for random projects -i ran the mit salsa club for a few years. i'd love to say that means i'm really good or even good at it. unfortunately all it really means is that i think it's a lot of fun. -trampolining you know the protagonist in how to tame your dragon? that's kinda me. though i don't have such a squeaky voice. music: glashaus / cassandra steen, hayley westenra, perasma, u2, seal, vanessa mae, kate ryan, sarah brightman, xavier naidoo, owl city, gigi d'agostino, alize, engelina, zaz. plenty of others, but that's probably enough for now.  books: anything by khalil gibran (i think he's the most brilliant writer ever, not just for the prophet). personal recollections of joan of arc (definitely favorite novel ever). do they hear when you cry (excluding the first 100 pages or so). shaking hands with the devil (incredible & sincere perspectives, painful as it was to read). rumi.  movies/tv: avatar: the last airbender (not the movie!), pinky and the brain. serenity/firefly/nathan fillion in general. matrix (1 always, 2&3 after i got a graduate degree in media studies and finally became able to understand them). big bang theory. most movies in the movies_that_matter genre (promises project, amistad, innocent voices, whale rider, etc). most animated movies / anim. legend of the seeker. lotr. how lotr should have ended. rowan atkinson live. i don't even remember what it was called, but there was an australian cartoon about stick figures drawn in the sand that each each represented a vowel, and all they'd ever say is that particular vowel in different intonations as they ran away from evil consonants. also _die sendung mit der maus_. i hope every language i have to learn has a show that wonderful!  food: anything healthy i'm guessing i'm supposed to go with all the things i really could do without, but that don't make boring answers (family, etc). so: -trader joes -yoga swing -really good tea or water kefir -the colors teal (or turquoise) and purple -water (rivers, lakes, waterfalls, oceans, etc) -a full night sleep, followed by a day with decent exercise somewhere in it (dancing, jogging, skating, sailing, yoga, etc) less serious: how did people first decide to start drinking milk? video games that use direct neural controls. breathing patterns, heart-rate variability rhythms & 12hz brain waves. what life is like for a 4-year old and how not to lose that perspective. random days of thinking all in german. the potency of fiction & entertainment media to catalyze people. trying to get the benny lava song and literal version of total eclipse of the heart out of my head. how cool those little bikes for 2-year olds with no pedals (laufrder) are. how to convince people reading online dating websites that it's actually ok to end sentences with copula verbs or prepositions.  more serious: how divided and confused humanity becomes from people feeling like they have to be able to define, label and quantify everything. especially when it comes to more abstract topics like religion. my views on the subject are probably way too nuanced to fit into an online profile (i'm bahai if that means anything to you). but, basically, on the one hand i'm frustrated by how illogical/destructive organized religion and people's unquestioning attachments to rituals & traditions can be. on the other, i think the founders of the major world religions had extraordinary insight into the human condition, were who they claimed to be, and, despite what it often seems in the world, that there's a beautiful underlying framework tying them all together for anyone who really looks for it. and not just a fluffy superficial one, actual meaningful interconnections between people from abraham to joseph smith.  i had one religious parent and one not, from very different cultures. i think that led to a healthy process of seeing all the similarities in both approaches to life. it really can vary. it could be just staying at home scheming new ways to outsource more of my life to hungary. maybe out dancing or at acroyoga or something. or at discussion groups my friends often host on global affairs and spiritual development. or with roommates playing board games or cooking some random afghani fusion dish. generally i have some sort of project or another i'm always working on that keeps me busy. though i wouldn't consider it below me by any means to just spend friday night curled up with a good book or video game. i have a crush on the xkcd girl? i guess if you also feel totally overwhelmed with the myriad things out there in life you want to explore, and think it would just be funner to have someone else on to conquer them with. you both love culture (in all sense of the word: {popular} humanistic endeavor, global diversity, yogurt) and consider yourself a problem-solver at heart.  note: i'm probably not actually \"online now\", it just says that. maybe because i have the mobile version on? or possibly to do with the program i wrote to search through this site for me. (yes, i realize how pathetically nerdy writing a program to go through a dating site sounds. but, seriously, how does anyone find anything on this site with the default search? also if you have an issue with nerdy, given that i have a star trek voyager rerun running an the background as i'm writing this, things may not work anyway)\n",

      "i'm adventurous and love spontaneous outings and trips. i usually try to fill my weekends with outdoor activities (hanging out at the beach, snowboarding, hiking, long bike rides) or get togethers with my friends (movies, wine, trying out local restaurants, bars). i'm very open with my emotions, a great listener, and very warm hearted. i've had a string of bad relationships a few years back and decided that i was going to focus on my education and career. i'm curious to see what kind of dating and relationship opportunities sites like these can offer. i work hard and enjoy the occasional party, but i don't go overboard. i'm a very passionate person, open minded, and tend to life by the motto of \"living life with no regrets.\" i love romantic guys who aren't afraid to do something cheesy. i'm currently pursing a career i'm passionate about. i haven't had the best of luck when it comes to relationships, but i'm hopeful that the right person will come around soon enough. conversation, writing music (not so great on the guitar or piano yet, self teaching myself), rocking out to music in my car - head banging, singing, air guitar, air drums and all :) my smile, personality.. a lot of people tune into my laid back \"islander way of life\" (what i've been told). i rarely have time to watch tv these days, so thank you netflix - in love with prison break, lost, grey's anatomy, vampire diaries, and glee at the moment.  books - atonement, wuthering heights, poisonwood bible, blue blood, nineteen minutes.  movies - so many to mention, so here's a short list.. house bunny, butterfly effect, the strangers, underworld trilogy, dear john, inception, tangled, american history x, crash, baby mama.  music - a little bit of everything, even country.  food - sushi! 1. my amazing family and friends.. i'm surrounded by a loving, hilarious, loyal bunch! 2. my cell phone.. lifeline. 3. my guitar.. i'm poetic, write music, and am comforted by the warm sounds of an acoustic guitar. 4. my ipod, music.. there will always be a song that can capture my emotions. 5. hope and faith.. because no matter how many trials and obstacles i've had to face, hope and faith helps crutch my weaknesses. 6. love or the thought of finding true love.. i've always had the dream of finding the one person who could make the rest of the world disappear. where i'll be in a few years, my next spontaneous weekend trip to tahoe or la, my next vacation or biking/hiking outing with friends, the possibility of true love. it really depends on the weather. if i'm out with friends you'd probably find me at a pool hall, movies, or at a restaurant/bar enjoying a few beers or cocktails. if i choose to stay indoors, i'd probably be hosting a movie night or reading a good book. this profile started out as a \"dare\".. but i'm testing the waters out and i'm secretly hoping i find someone i can get to know, share adventures, create memories, and (hopefully) experience love with. you think we're compatible, want to chat, think we could be a match.. what's the worse that could happen?\n",

      "i think i might be interesting and am atypical in a million ways. i don't take myself too seriously and i tend not to take others especially seriously, especially if they, themselves are.  i am very good and extremely professional at my work and yet i generally hit my two alarms at least 3 times in the morning and am possibly awake for less than 15 minutes before getting into my car. and in that time i have woken my son, let the dogs out and have already had a cup of coffee. translation -- not especially high maintenance and i move quickly. i am passionate about my work -- it is very grounding and allows me to be exactly who i am.  i am raising a young son as an only parent. on weekends you might be tempted to call me a \"soccer mom\" because my son plays soccer. or lacrosse. or basketball. but i have never been exactly like other \"soccer moms\". of course, coming from the midwest allows me to yell at the sidelines in a, not always \"marin county\" way. i am passionate about his education and yet feel it is more important for a boy to attend the sf giants world series parade than school. and i am pretty sure i frighten (or at least confuse and make uncomfortable ) the more uptight moms at school.  i am equally as comfortable in heels and a short skirt as i am in mud boots or bare feet. i have a strong tendency to behave as i feel and have never been one to conform to the \"norm\". i have had many varied experiences over the years and am not driven by what others think about what i do, feel or how i act. although, as i say this, please know that i am kind and compassionate and care enormously about others' feelings and am very sensitive. i care about things that i believe matter.  i see funny in dark places and i know myself and am honest about my most passionate traits, as well as my quirkiest of quirks. i am adventurous and fun, a tad irreverent and yet have an extremely quiet side. i have known amazing, wonderful and passionate love, as well as great sorrow and tragedy. i have a very solid perspective on what matters.  i love to travel and very much enjoy driving. i have eclectic tastes in pretty much everything and although i keep more balls in the air than most (out of necessity) i can spend hours tending to my flowers. it matters to me to live a meaningful life - one that has a positive impact on the world. i am also raising a happy, well-adjusted little boy as an only parent. i was happily married when my husband died of cancer, very suddenly and unexpectedly, 6 years ago.  i work very hard and also enjoy my downtime. i have a bustling household with a lot of activity in it. in recent years i have become more and more interested in urban farming and am now raising 9 chickens (update - flighty girl chicken farms has just been decreased to 8. turns out sydney was actually a rooster which is not a way to keep your neighbors's happy. my friends are extremely important to me.  i did not plan to be alone at this age and i would very much like to share my life with someone wonderful. - laughing - making people feel comfortable. - organization and seeing the \"big picture\" readily. - my profession - it allows me to be honest to who i am. - creating a home environment that is warm and full of life. - writing - it is simply what i do. - getting lost and landing in the worst parts of town, in any city, anywhere in the world. i'm like a magnet. - being terribly irreverent and, i'm afraid, not especially politically correct. - seeing what is funny in the world around me. i am warm and personable, high energy and i smile easily and often. i have my very own style of fashion. and i'm small. just how it is. i read quite a bit. i actually love professional journals, magazines etc. my taste in books is mostly stuff that relaxes my head -- murder mysteries, etc. -- somewhat mindless, pure entertainment. you will never find me reading anything on oprah's book list. i am not attracted to cathartic stories- i think there is enough of that in real life.  my favorite book of the last few years is shantaram -- it is true story, written as fiction, about an australian man who, having escaped from prison, lived a very interesting life while free for 10 years. i very much liked the character and thought the writing was among the best i have seen in years. and, of course, i love the entire \"girl with the dragon tattoo\" series. lisbeth is a character i understand. how can you not love her? i am now reading some classics to my son. painful as it is, lord of the rings is a classic in my family.  i very much enjoy film-- all different types, as well as live theater, music and events.  music is very important to me. i know old music, current music and lots of different genres. my home/ car is filled with music. i am already seeing the generation gap with my 11 year old. katy perry and lady gaga are not doing it for me. thankfully, he has a bit of his mother in him, in that we both really like eminem. spotify could be the best thing ever. i like to listen to a good band at the independent, fillmore or fox.  dining -- ah- i have lots of varied tastes. i can enjoy a good burger as well as something amazing from an new restaurant in the city. i am also mad for cajun food. and i do not eat like a bird (well, technically, i probably do since they eat alot) i'm picking more than 6 because i can  - my son and the bustle of children - fresh flowers, my garden - music - huge for me: from garage punk to eminem, rockabilly, blues, kick-ass country chicks, anything jack white, opera and so much more - a good, large dog (or two) - pasta and coffee - good, strong coffee - books - lots of them. poetry, novels, research, dr. suess - a sense of humor - in myself as well as those around me. how amazing sleep is and that i wish i had more of it! who knows? i could be home folding laundry in my sweats while watching a movie or out with friends. either are equally as likely. i still think prince's early, rather nasty stuff is completely hot. you actually got this far. you are honest and generally happy. grounded and have a wicked sense of humor. feeling as though this whole internet dating thing is completely ridiculous is a big plus. i would like to meet in person rather than do a lot of emailing. it's just more practical.\n",

      "hmm. i try not to be jaded, but i find that a lot of the time i am. i try to be adventurous in every way i can and my list of things i must do before dying is getting shorter every day because i do them, not because i change my mind. i infuse my own flavors of booze, i am a pyromaniac, i blend oils and i'm a jewelry designer (which means that i drink well, accessorize well, smell fantastic and play with fire.) but am also a wage slave with a more boring day job. i think the sound of breaking glass is cathartic, motorcycle races and fast cars make me hyper, hurling myself out of a perfectly good airplane makes me giddy and a spectacular explosion will always win a cheer and a giggle. i have a lot of large tattoos but only my ears are pierced. i live an 'alternative' lifestyle, whatever that means and am almost never unarmed. i have little baggage compared to most people i know, but no one has just a carry on these days. i work through it and i hope for someone who does the same. i do not believe that people change in general and i work very hard to accept that although i do sometimes forget. i'd love to be surprised in a good way. i'm very good at listening to other people but not so good about talking about myself so i don't very often. i make it a point to learn something every day. i don't like bugs, bees or clowns. i do like books, shooting and coffee. most of the people in my life have been in it for at least a decade, so clearly i tend to develop long and close relationships. i forgive but i never forget. it takes an exceptionally long time for my temper to rise, but when it does i fight dirty and come out clean. i try to stay away from unnecessary drama at all times. i love all kinds of music, am a well read person & it is just as likely that you will find me at home curled up on the couch with a book, as it is that you'll walk into a bar and see me dancing on top of it - it simply depends on the mood. i'm looking for someone who has the capacity to do the same - and is comfortable on either end of the spectrum my goal would be to work for myself, of course - but at this point i am just trying to be able to supplement my income with my art and figure out a way to travel a lot more than i do. i make an effort to learn something new every day i'm great at listening to people. i seem to be good at being 'one of the boys'. i can keep secrets. i am great at grand gestures - but sometimes things fall by the wayside in day to day life. apparently i'm great at collecting unavailable men - and would like the universe to stop sending them to me cleavage, unfortunately. then eyes. there are so many books..... irish history, fiction, hunter s thompson, neil gaiman, george rr martin movies... boondock saints, wings of desire, true romance, fight club shows are ncis, anthony bourdain's no reservations, bbc news, sons of anarchy, rescue me food's getting more adventurous.... in no particular order - music friends love art sushi large bodies of water the worst case scenario and how to avoid it. i'm not necessarily a doomsayer, but i like to be prepared for anything - and then am not usually so shocked or disappointed when things go to hell reading a book, since i actually work on saturday mornings. but saturday nights are a different story i think this question is a crock. if you want to know something like that, you have to get to know me first you have actually read this profile, do not identify as a 'burner' and still think it's a good idea.\n",
      "what is most important, it seems to me, has something do with the \"heart.\" despite the ambiguity of such a statement, i walk with it as one of my guide posts.  i am thoughtful, intelligent, and committed to a journey of growth and adventure where humor figures prominently. but this life includes tragedy and sadness as much as beauty and joy. i can hold and honor both.  i love, love the wild placeshike, backcountry ski, backpack, and run rivers into those wild places. around here i run and bike in the hills or down by the water, sing and play guitar, paint some, dance some, yoga some, at times goofy and boisterous, at other times quite, introspective, and enjoying alone timea beautiful work in progress. despite my penchant for movement, i also love and need to sometimes just lay around, garden, and move with slow.  nobody guesses my age, and usually folks will say i am trying to kid them. i do sometimes make stuff up when i am particularly happy, but i really am fifty. a dear friend who i have played music with and just bantered with for many years says at times he sees a terrific wild wolf in meand he just laughs and laughs. somehow, a couple of girls i am close with (age 7 & 9) also see the wolf in me, and they love best when we play with that character. and although i piloted a wolf study program in the mountains of washington many years ago, i somehow sense the raven at my core; a character who took me in after many years of wilderness travel through the deeply crazed canyons of utah's colorado plateau. thus am i a playful trickster prone to either a melancholic gaze or a radiant blast of loving appreciation.  i am trying not to place too many limitations on what kind of relationship i am looking for. this comes after recently having my world opened up by an adventurous young woman, where i realized that precious gifts come in many packages and may not conform to a list of desires and/or expectations. however, it is also very true that i would some day like to be in a committed long term relationship with a woman. in any case, i strive for an incredible honesty while we each live our own alivenesswhether that is for three weeks or thirty years. making a positive difference and contribution to the world. working as a somatic psychotherapist, and mostly loving the work. growing myself and deepening relationships with others. listening; and asking questions--without needing answers. seeing the absurd. seeing something beautiful. (i have taken pictures since childhood, so my eye, heart and mind meld things.) giving a massage. exploring. letting go of \"time.\" hmm--my smile and my curiois sense of homor. my blue eyes. books: books hinting at the human condition. rilke, david whyte, terry tempest williams, stanley keleman.  music: rock, folk, alternative, jam bands, new age and classical.  food: i tend towards vegetarian but quite enjoy seared flesh in the summer. organic is good. now experimenting with raw. yet i also like to cook.  movies: a good movie now and then, usually something that stirs. friendships. stillness, and the slow passing of the sun, or the stars, or the moon, or a river. adventures into the wilderness or simply climbing a tree or napping under a tree. touch--call it intimacy, vulnerability--call it essential. meaningful work. my guitar. solitude. furry friends. who am i, what am \"i\" doing here, and to what greatness am i called. the fact of my mortality. and then also, how to connect with a sweet heart. it really depends. relaxing with a friend at dinner or cooking in, a movie, a show, playing my guitar ... i am a bit shy. you would like to meet an easy going, youthful, and uncommon man who has a very attractive appeal. but let us first start with a few words of introduction here.\n",
      "i am an enigma disguised as a riddle hidden in a mystery... as a young child i was described as a \"natch'l man\". i'd say that pretty much holds true today. i am embracing change and moving into a new and different phase in my life. keeping it real...or selling out if anybody's buying... are usually not listed on a website... nothing but the best, later for the rest. too much to list, too little to matter... i try to live in a manner that doesn't make me beholden to things. deep thoughtful things...interspersed with random surreal non sequiturs...really. all about it... is also not going to be listed on a website. thanks for asking. you are looking to make a new acquaintance...i am not here to find a instant girlfriend, wife, lover, mistress, pro-domme or anything of the sort. i'm just looking to break out a bit and meet some new people. soooooo....\n",
      "i have lots to give and am happy to spoil the right person, but am definitely picky and would expect that you are too. i think love and affection are pretty much as good as it gets in this life. i don't mind wearing my heart on my sleeve and value honesty and straightforwardness in matters of the heart. i'm fun to hang out with and moms love me. most days i pass for normal. just finished grad school in december to become a chiropractor. currently studying for board exams and working with a chiropractor in san rafael.  and in case you are unfamiliar with chiropractic, you can watch this clip from the simpsons and it will explain everything! http://www.facebook.com/?ref=logo#!/video/video.php?v=1410477066676&ref=mf organizing events. seeing the good in people. not taking myself too seriously. driving 80 on the freeway, but 25 in residential. being a good friend. laughing. telling it like it is. dancing to 80's music and knowing the lyrics to every hit song from that decade. being dependable. usually some combo of height, heart and smile. i've been told i'm cuter in person. hopefully this means my personality brings something to the table. favorite all-time artist is bob dylan. other things i'm listening to or just love are johnny cash, yeah yeah yeahs, talking heads, modest mouse, at the drive-in, cat power, lucero, feist, le tigre, neil young, neutral milk hotel, the smiths, social distortion, and weezer and then i can equally get down to kanye, beyonce, gaga, and a bunch of other top 40 that is great to dance to. my pandora is currently stuck on girl talk.  favorite movies--anything by wes anderson, sophia coppola, and jim jarmusch. i am a typical woman who is a sucker for chick flicks and rom coms but i also love action blockbusters, gangster movies, and comic book superhero flicks.  i love food and it's a good thing that i got the skinny gene from my father or we'd have a problem. i was vegetarian for half my life and have been reintroducing myself to the carnivorous side of things over the past few years. i'm still pretty veggie heavy, but if you want to cook me something with meat in it, i won't say no.  currently reading the happiness project and next up is outliers. also, don't judge, but i just finished the hunger games trilogy. so good! it's really the people and places that i could never do without, but six things i love are: love music (pandora!) good food the internets meditation happiness the human body. why we are here and what's it all about. love and service. how i can be a better person. how i got to be so lucky. the double-edged sword of technology. and a bunch of other stuff.  also how oktrends say that iphone users get laid more than android users (http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/dont-be-ugly-by-accident/). does that mean if you buy an iphone you'll get laid more? or is it that people that get laid more buy iphones? i'd like to make the argument that we android users prefer function over fashion...although, i will admit that siri is pretty cool. hanging out with friends, eating out, going to the movies or some other fun thing to keep life interesting. when i'm flying solo--at the gym or studying. i never know if the old dating rules apply on the internet or to our generation. also sometimes i think it would be funny to put up a cleavage shot just to see how it would affect my inbox. [update: recently tested my hypothesis...it works, duh, but we all knew that ;)].  i think this might be my favorite box. i especially like how uncomfortable it makes people. it just says your \"most private thing\" which by definition doesn't even have to be private because it's relative.  and i heart bsg...eat your heart out sci fi geeks :) you are smart, funny, lighthearted, creative, driven, confident, positive, up for a challenge, taller than me, well-traveled, a badass (at something you love), you've sewn your wild oats, you live in a metropolitan area (preferably the same one as me) and you're looking for something meaningful and long term.  like you, i have a love/hate relationship with online dating and like you, i keep doing this because i'm an optimist. it's hard to determine compatibility and chemistry online. sometimes it can be determined within seconds of meeting someone in person. so let's keep it simple and meet for afternoon coffee, or what someone on here called the 'zero' date, to see if we might make it to a first date.  also, i can be a bit old-fashioned. so go ahead and make the first move.\n",

      "1. i grew up near monterey, ca, and moved up to san francisco after college in santa barbara. i love the ocean. being on the beach makes me feel like i'm really part of the larger world.  2. my favorite word is \"pants.\" i think it's funny. it's especially funny in compound nouns like \"underpants\" and \"company pants.\" pants.   3. i'm kind of handy. i was once late for work because i was busy removing and repairing all of the 100-year-old doorknob mechanisms in my apartment.  4. i love to travel and have done a fair amount of it. i've done most of my traveling in europe. paris is my favorite city in the whole world (so far).  5. my first crush was on a boy in kindergarten who always had messy hair and holes in the knees of his pants.  6. for the last decade or so, i've had an intellectual crush on the now 78-year-old neurologist oliver sacks. i've seen him speak twice, and i think he's just fascinating.  7. i have a musical crush on jeff buckley and kings of leon.  8. i have a comedic crush on will forte from snl and jemaine from flight of the conchords--goofballs. a good sense of humor is really important to me. i used to think it was important to everyone, but it turns out it's not!  9. i'll spend 4 months trying to decide whether to get a new cell phone or just replace the battery in my old phone, but i can walk into a car dealership, choose a car, test drive it, sign the requisite forms, and drive it off the lot in 42 minutes flat. (if you're wondering, in the end i decided to get a new battery for my old phone.)  10. violin and cello music can bring forth tears from some deep part of my being that has no words. it surprises me sometimes. trumpets make me laugh--that does not surprise me. the snl sketch in which will forte (see #8) dances like a freak to herb alpert's trumpety casino royale kills me.  11. i'm on an eternal search for the perfect haircut and consequently have cut my hair to within an inch of its life on three separate occasions over the past 17 years.  12. i like pretty, girly shoes, but you'll usually find me stomping around town in my elfin dansko clogs or my frye boots. they're just so dang comfortable!  13. i've fallen (hard) twice in the past year and half, both times due to the thick, unbending soles of my dansko clogs. and yet i keep wearing them  14. no less than three times (so far) i've made one of my friends laugh so hard that she peed in her pants. one of the times we were grocery shopping with five other people and she had to go wait in the car. another time, she kept screaming at me to stop laughing so that she could stop laughing long enough to make it to the bathroom. but the time i made her laugh while she was drinking water was the least pleasant for me because she spit right in my face.  15. i try to stay away from negativity. who needs it?  16. i wish i could speak a second language fluently.  17. i love roller coasters.  18. i'm 43, but most of the time i feel like i'm 14. is that good or bad? i don't know. working a lot. i work from home writing textbooks, and i can't imagine going back into an office. people ask me if it's difficult to be disciplined enough to work from home, but deadlines keep me in line. also, myers briggs tells me i'm an infj, and that's pretty accurate, particularly the i (introvert) part. i'm fortunate enough to have some truly amazing and very close friends, and i love spending time with people, but too much time with people wears me out. i need a lot of alone time to recharge. being a friend, listening, writing, seeing humor in unexpected places, remaining calm in alarming situations. that depends on the person, i guess. i always feel intimidated by the word \"favorite,\" but here's a random list of stuff that i like. movies: amelie, willy wonka and the chocolate factory, lars and the real girl, the breakfast club, paradise lost (about the west memphis 3--so glad they're out of jail, but not happy that they're still considered guilty!) books: (so many. i read a lot--mostly fiction.) the history of love by nicole krauss, cruddy by lynda barry, geek love by katherine dunn, the curious incident of the dog in the night-time by mark haddon, the spellman series by lisa lutz. right now i'm reading the george r. r. martin series. music: right now i'm listening to the black keys, adele, blind pilot, the decemberists, the head and the heart, kings of leon, jeff buckley (always listening to him). also have a soft spot for old motown and classic rock. food: almost anything. i love food. when shopping, i buy organic unless that's not an option. i try to stay away from non-foods--foodstuffs that are made of chemicals, plastics, and wood fiber. but sometimes, i get a hankering for taco bell. friends, family, books, music, silence, my brain what i have to do. i can get overwhelmed by my to-do list, but i'm working on that. i also consciously try to remember that we're all in this crazy life together, and we all have the choice of making each other's lives more pleasant or more difficult. i try, when i can, to make my fellow human beings' lives more pleasant--sometimes all it takes is a friendly hello or letting someone merge ahead of me in traffic. probably doing something pretty mellow like going out to dinner or seeing a movie with friends, or just hanging out by myself. i think i've already shared what i'm willing to share. you're intrigued and want to know more, i suppose.\n",

      "my name is ben. i'm a decent looking, broad shoulder, tall type. i have a professional job and a down-to-earth attitude.  my ideal mate is a pretty woman who wears high heels when appropriate but also loves being in nature, and loves being natural. i like to entertain friends and family, hang out with other couples, and i like to cook.  i read a lot and write. my one big aspiration is to publish a novel. otherwise i do what i wanted to do for a living. live where i wanted to live. i've always wanted to visit europe, so i'm going to spend june traveling around the mediterranean. barcelona to istanbul in 30 days. i tend to do whatever i set out to do.  aside from my darling niece, who is living on my sofa currently, i'm alon. while i prefer to be with someone i'm kinda picky and willing to wait for someone i really get along with. i'd say i like beautiful women but most really beautiful women don't think of themselves that way, so i'll just say i'm waiting for someone who is beautiful to me.  the most important thing in a relationship for me is enjoying the company of the other person. going to see the world reading out loud. my job. being reasonable and figuring things out. my voice i'm interested in too many things to list them. i'm reading three books, writting two books, listening to two other books. and that's just the reading/writting part. sunshine, rain, trees, mountains, the moon and stars the world we live in and where its going. the way good authors express the reality of how people think, feel, and why they act as they do either out with friends or alone at home. i do my best partying on wednesdays i'm not willing to share anything private on a public website. wait, am i being to literal here? you want to live life like a romantic comedy but not make your boyfriend watch them on tv :)\n",
      "i am not interested in casual sex. please wear a tie.  *** bisy backson *** (if you get the reference, punk rock points for you. if you google, you might find me.)  update: no time, lo siento. it's not you, it's me. life's a whirlwind right now. still down to meet new folks, just not as flexible as before. if you still feel so inclined, please leave a message and i'll get back to you as soon as i can. :) ***  so apparently i signed up for this site a million years ago, but have only been active for a few months. obviously the handle is a zoolander reference, but i can't remember why-- i didn't like the movie *that* much.  there are some interesting folks out there, and when i squeeze the time in, i'd like to meet more of you.  startup grunt by day, performer/producer/dance instructor by night. 25/7 businesswoman. i know how to work the reading glasses just as well as my stilettos. you won't find me at yoga or in the gym, but i've made occasional cameos on lightweight hiking trails, the beach (when it's nice out), or more likely, enjoying a strong drink in the company of friends at one of the bay area's lesser known dives. i can carry a conversation and know what's happening in the world around me but i prefer to keep it light with witty banter. i can be shy in a large crowd and appreciate the person who knows how to give that special glance that makes me feel like we are the only two people in the room.  i am stronger than i look, smarter than i sound, and take up more space than you would expect.  also, i'm not afraid to make the first move. gearing up for upcoming shows, revamping my class syllabus, putting together choreography for new group pieces, rewriting my media kit. dreaming/scheming of ways to run my own co-op dance/personal training studio. carving out time to meet new friends and hang out with old ones. re-obsessing over xkcd and other interweb distractions.  otherwise: drinking vodka tonics, craving moqueca de camarao, relearning how to cook, dancing on a stage, shooting the shit, geeking out on web design, and narrating my life as a cole porter musical.  i have a lifelong crush on phoebe cates and mary stuart masterson.  val kilmer's doc holliday is one of my favorite movie characters ever. and of course, the powell/loy duo never gets old. - dancing - making myself laugh every day - naming the best spots to grab a drink - teaching women how to reclaim their sexy - being adorkable i'm little! but look much bigger on stage. glitter and sequins and rhinestones and tassels... music and dancing and food and no-hassles... html and css tags, too... favorite things, these are just but a few...  neil gaiman's sandman series. short stories. 90's hiphop. anita o'day. ella fitzgerald. sarah vaughan. billie holiday. ellington. armstrong. prima. jordan. ray charles. patsy cline. ceu. astrud, bebel, joao gilberto. the thin man. my girl friday. kiss kiss bang bang. arrested development. how i met your mother. dexter. colbert report. the daily show. nero wolfe. - laughter - friends and family - the interwebs - music - dance - coffee or wine (hell, i ain't too picky!) what's for dinner? staying in and getting high on e-6000 and watching an old flick. unless i'm out performing on a stage near you. i don't really know what \"dating\" is supposed to be. i like to meet new folks, hang out, become friends. sometimes they become friends with occasional benefits, sometimes they become long-term platonic partners-in-crime, sometimes they become one-hit-wonders/novelties, and even less often they become all of the above (boyfriend/girlfriend/significant other/your preferred term here)... i truly believe that we all affect one another's lives, for better or worse, no matter how temporary or permanent. so i make the most of it. i prefer to extend a smiling face and open affection over the alternative. i'm too old to play stupid mind games. if you ask me anything, my first instinct is to tell the truth. my second instinct is to be quiet and mull it over (sometimes leaving you with enough time to come to your own conclusions). my third instinct (if 1 or 2 hadn't resolved it) is to simply state i refuse to answer question.  also, i have a soft spot in my heart for anyone who can explain quantum physics to me as if i was an 8-year-old. - you've got a good story to tell. - you're an artist, writer, musician, photographer, dancer, prop-maker, etc. who's interested in collaborating. - you can talk as if we've known each other for a while. i admit: i'm pretty bad at small talk, so why don't we just pretend we're already friends? - you're local, have a (face) photo, and look like your photo. - you can hold your liquor, a conversation, and my interest.  please don't bother messaging me if: - you have strong feelings *against* glitter, sequins, and rhinestones. - you can't string more than two words at a time. - you don't know when (and not) to use an apostrophe.\n",
      "i'm a whirlwind of energy and pretty certain that \"dreams\" can be accomplished if you work hard enough. i've often gone without sleep to get things done, but i definitely also appreciate sleeping in and having lazy streaks.  i grew up in philly with a healthy dose of mass transit and public school, but my family's been in the southwest for awhile now. so despite being a concrete snob, i got a dose of appreciation for the great outdoors. i love dogs, mine is a yellow lab named laddoo. he lives with my parents actually, but whatever, he loves me best. exploring san francisco for the next two months until april. i've lived in dc, nyc and philly so far and am totally psyched to skip winter :)  i'm a lawyer (the cool kind). pre-lawyer life, i was a professional in the performing arts. i mix-up the two whenever i can by writing reviews, seeing shows, and staying in the loop. for a long time i lived a double life: student/employee by day and artist/producer by night. it got confusing which is why i had to consolidate personalities.  future dreams include: teaching legal issues in the arts to artists, choreographing for a music video, starting my own dance company, and publishing a research book. somewhere in there i'd like to squeeze in a puppy...a family (one day)...and so on. organizing stuff. decorating (like furniture and walls, not holiday stuff). making people laugh. doing various kinds of laughs. quick meals. remembering roads and directions. walking. asking questions. snoozing repeatedly on a daily basis. finding answers to stuff. procrastinating. reading my horoscope to avoid working on a late night... i have a nose ring (stud?) and i smile a lot. the economist, wsj, cnbc biographies, weird documentaries (ranging from pbs specials on community college to who killed the electric car). the good wife, selling new york, outsourced.  spicy food! coffee shops (especially ones with good pastry). dive bars, or depending on the mood, wine bars.  electronica, drum & bass, nitin sawheny, normal radio poppy music, nuevo tango, flamenco, \"high school music\" (which would be incubus, u2, smashing pumpkins, etc.). microwave, smartphone, contact lenses, google, calls with my closest friends, family what new neighborhood i should explore in san fran.  choreography. how to become a copyright professor and what kind of company i'd like to create. big picture stuff. poverty and inequality (but i no longer want to save the world, i've become a pessimist in that respect). how to make my billable hours. whether i will ever bench my own weight. where i was in grade school when everyone else learned to hit space bar twice after a period. at work, at the gym, with friends having drinks or dinner, or home sweet home, sitting on my crappy couch and loving not doing anything at all. i get antsy when kids somehow find and steal the teddy bear that i've had since i was four years old. i'm perfectly happy to share everything, but not my care bear. you're inquisitive, creative, funny, intelligent, down to earth, and have a life ambition.  you're south asian.  you're somewhere in the bay area, or nyc, philly or dc...\n",
      "i strongly identify as a geek but i never quite fit the mold, or any mold for that matter. i don't think i care very much for molds anyhow. still, i'm not much of a rebel, i'm too low-key for that.  i spend a lot of time with my poly-freak-burner friends. they're my tribe. i like having a tribe. i like finally feeling like i belong (at least most of the time). yep, i've been out to that thing in the desert multiple times and will probably go again. i've had some beautiful experiences there and some less beautiful ones...  i grew up in israel. about 5 years ago i just picked up and moved to san francisco. i've only looked back once and i never regretted the decision to stay. i love san francisco, it is my home.  i'm technically jewish (it's a hard thing to shake off) but if this is the main reason for you to contact me, you might as well not bother. i'm not big on religion and i hate organized religion. i'm slowly becoming more open to spirituality but i care about having a decent understanding of life more than i care about understanding the universe and everything. i guess i'm just practical that way.  i believe that life is too short for bad beer, fast food or mediocre ice-cream. i try to enjoy the better things and i like to share them with my friends. i try not to be a snob about it but sometimes that's hard.  i'm a city boy. i need the energy of a city around me. i love the variety, the options, the people, the houses and towers, the skyline, randomly walking around... but i also have room for nature: hiking, camping or just wandering around the park on a sunny day.  in a room full of people, i'm usually the one in the back, looking, observing, absorbing. in a smaller group, you'd find me chatting non-stop about the latest idea that's been racing inside my head.  this is probably the most \"i\" sentences i've used in quite a while. i don't do this often.  i am a geek, a bit of a freak, and i like elephants lately i'm trying to make my life more about life. i'm exploring my spiritual side, i've been reading about buddhism and am trying to develop a sustainable meditation practice.  i try to be more active, going to the gym and hiking on occasion. i've recently discovered indoor climbing so i'm checking that out as well.  i'm finding new ways to express my creativity and create physical things. i've been involved in several projects, making things and learning skills. it's fun! cuddling. really, ask anyone.  computers too. we get along pretty well...  drinking beer. good beer for the most part, ales to be specific. extra hoppy triple ipas if i can find them...  doing weird things with bacon (like putting it on a stick and covering it with chocolate). you'd probably notice i tend to be kinda quiet (unless i got excited about something and i'm talking someone's ear off). in fiction i mostly read fantasy and sci-fi (zelazny, pratchett, gibson, lewis, card, moorcock, stephenson, geiman, leiber, doctorow... you get the picture?). i have been known to read some \"fine\" literature as well. lately, dharma bums, on the road, electric kool-aid acid test (well, that's not completely fiction), one flew over the cuckoo's nest, fear & loathing in las-vegas and sometimes a great notion all blew my mind.  in non-fiction, i've learned much from the selfish gene, smart mobs, the wise heart, prometheus rising (and other by raw), the ethical slut, urban tribes and i swear one day i'm gonna finish reading godel, escher, bach.  movies? there's really too many to count. juno, superbad, knocked up, easy rider, big lebowsky, 10 things i hate about you, coraline, adaptation, eternal sunshine, starship troopers, hackers... some are eternal classics and some are frivolous moments of fun.  as for music, i listen to quite a wide variety depending on my mood. a sampling from the top of my itunes: pixies, nick cave, beatles, amon tobin, dresden dolls, fratellis, frank sinatra, string cheese incident, polyphonic spree, supertramp, tons of classic 70s rock and some psychedelic stuff as well, pogues, some electronic stuff mostly glitchy or trippy when i'm being mellow or dirty and breaky when i feel like dancing...  i eat pretty much whatever's put in front me. not so much meat lately but i do enjoy a good burger. sushi, pho, thai, mediterranean (when i can find some that's decent), indian food... oh and i love soup. 1. touch. physical contact. closeness. have i mentioned cuddles already?  2. my little bay area tribe of friends.  3. a computer with decent 'net access (i could probably go a few weeks without but yeah...)  4. the city.  hrm... i guess i don't really require all that much. overthinking. probably hanging out with friends... at a pub with some beer, at a club with serious bass in the background or maybe at some campground around a fire (that last one tends to also include the beer and the music). just as likely, i'm at home watching a movie on my own and relaxing from the strains of my not-so-busy life :) i actually don't eat nearly as much bacon as some people seem to think i do. but please don't tell anyone! you would like to know more. also if you're poly (or are interested in exploring polyamorous relationships) and are looking for more than just a passing fling.\n",
      "i'm well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand like a lizard on a window pane. and i'm 'hella' original.  as of now, i'm silly and all sorts of serious, you pick. ive answered way too many questions, then started having fun with them, i guess i should pick up a good book when im trying to sleep. hope you're all having a lovely ol' time. i work with special folks (dd) during the day because i love it, and majoring in the same field, so yes i am going to school and doin it, doin it, doin it well. summer break is here! so, until fall semester starts... working, chillin', continuing creative projects i put off in favor of studying, day-tripping, visiting bodies of water and playing in it. um... trying to figure out what to write on this okstupid website, ah i don't care... anyway.... zzzzzzzz.....zzzzzzzz....... digital imaging, loving my camera, fine art and sometimes i tinker with audio. whistling my favorite songs and the ones you hate, perfectly. taking photos, fighting riptides (not that good), being silly and so fr'kk'n seriously serious in a \"no, really\" seriously serious kind of way. seriously. appreciating nature. being a positive role model to the little molecules all around to the best of my ability. i'm not so good at surfing :-( never quitting, always fun. hating foot and leg cramps while swimming. shark bait. whatever, i don't care as long as i'm floatin' in it. not being an outdoors extreme freak, i like to keep it recreational, the less i see it as excorcise (hehehe) the better. i'd tell you but... \"i'm pretty sure, there's more to life than being really, really ridiculously good-looking.\" (favorite movie quote ever) no really: the little bits of my inner self that leak out every now and then (sounds gross and i meant it that way) my rock-star qualities and the lack of groupies. the nut shell i am trapped in and what kind of shell has a nut like this? the stupid \"man suit\" i'm wearing. *i quote my favorite movie lines* when appropriate of course. last thing they notice: strangers say i'm awesome, they tell me before i have to leave the premises. aww :-) the only compliment i'd accept without hesitation. i love most alternative, some 80's new wave, classic and psychedelic rock. a few of my many favorites are: fugazi, the folk implosion, nirvana, the b-52's, the white stripes, sonic youth, radiohead, beck, gorillaz, ziggy stardust, the velvet underground, the beatles, the kinks, zappa and the mothers, 13th floor elevators, jimi hendrix and black sabbath(minus dio). you can never go wrong with johnny cash. sure, i like some punk and a dash of classic metal. it's all good as long as it's creative, mind blowing, experimental, simple and/or expressive. gwar's first album makes me smile.  movies- if it makes me laugh, rethink my life, or blows me away, i'll dig it. ya dig? i always have jack ass 1, 2, & 3 within reach. harold and kumar, bill murray and will farrel flicks are awsome. what else? oh yeah and, requiem for a dream, run lola run, and, um, \"movies for kids who don't read good\". :-) *cough* :-) i don't watch movies very often. my list is always short. i can't remember all of my favorites at the moment.  television- the internet provides me with my occasional tv viewing. i watch few reality shows like obsessed and intervention(moderately or i'll want to shoot myself). unfortunately, a&e is turning into mtv. yuck. they'll make a show about anything now. \"dirty laundry\" what goes on behind the scenes, *what they really do when you think they're folding your clothes*, tues @ 10. \"whoopie!\" i love to watch pbs, nature, nova etc. youtube has great lectures on psychology, behavioral anthropology, autism, philosophy and other related subject matter that interests me. it takes the place of bedtime reading. yes, i am a visual and auditory learner and i like it that way. the audio book, a brief history of time was one of my favorites. stanford university has a great youtube channel, by the way. kinda nerdy? \"sweeeeeeeet!\"  food-i am mindful about what i eat and junk food does have a time and place. moderation is my favorite word. the ocean and my future home by an awesome beach (i'm currently doing without, but damn it, i will get what i want!) it's a healthy obsession. art, music, education, a good attitude, humor :-d pools of sorrow, waves of joy mindfulness. how miniscule and powerful we all really are. the latter up to you. how i'm going to make this world a little better, all the time (it can't get no worse ) when i'm going to the beach. the crappy expensive seats i'll get at the giants game. how many people with profiles are deceased, and just seem like they don't log in anymore. getting back into fitness, and *enjoying* it the way i used to, it feels great. awesome, taking a nap, studying, out and about, planning my weekend. i laugh at my own jokes and at myself, so you don't have to. you don't want to date, fuck, or marry your bike. yeah, i said it. you wear the stupid \"bunny suit\" ....you like mental torture :-d you're cool.\n",

      "revised: i give up on okcupid. though, i will leave it as another outlet to meet new people.  about me? i think this site has introduced a poor method of judging a potential friend/relationship. ladies, stop portraying something you're not. men? well, i don't look or read men's profiles. i get kicks out of \"smart\" people with bad ideals and hypocritical morals. ok i'm done.  i moved to the bay area about 3 years ago and could not have made a better decision. if you've ever been to bakersfield, ca you know exactly what i'm talking about. if you haven't you're better off.  i love music of all kinds. i love film. currently i am a sound engineer and freelance videographer. i also do on-location audio recording. going out to see live shows is a hobby of mine. i have recently indulged into photography. only film for now. digital is just too easy. when i'm not working or going to school i am usually recording music or sitting down at the nearby coffee shop with friends. there's something about watching people and observing their behaviors that i enjoy. also, i'm a drinker. love ales and good whiskey, though, i always like a good reason not to go to the bar.  i'm not a book worm nor do i have the vocabulary to impress you. sorry. i'm a pretty simple and curious minded individual and don't care too much for flattery directed towards me. i would rather be critiqued. not sure what else to say here. i am a student of sound engineering and life in general. i am a magnet for knowledge. though, i seem to lose my magneticity (yeah it's not a word) here and there and out fall valuable bits of precious knowledge. shit happens. making people laugh, walking on two feet, giving people the benefit of the doubt (which has shot me in my own foot too many times), keeping my head on my shoulders. hell. i'm really good at counting to 10. i'm good with my hands. (get your mind out of the gutter!) is the buger hanging from my nose that my friends just let me walk around with obliviously. my hair. i'm definitely not the only guy with hair like mine, but i can't get away from the comments. that and my clothes. i love me some vintage. oh, and fuck hipsters. it's a self-centered superficial state of mind if you ask me. not to mention, i'm not cool enough to be one anyway. (fine by me) books: (not much of a reader. i really wish i was) science of the mind mostly what i do read is non-fiction. i like to read forums and comment columns from the latest news. i, also, am probably not reading your blog. nothing personal. ok maybe a little.  movies: there will be blood, the road, momento, ip man, blow, casino, dancer in the dark, city of god, super troopers, man on the moon, truman show, what dreams may come, the big lebowski, burn after reading, barton fink, super bad, pineapple express, i love you man, cloudy with a chance of meatballs. toy story 1 2 & 3. true grit was ok. and so many many more...  shows: southpark, mythbusters, always sunny, most national geographic shows, breaking bad. some others.  music: i am a connoisseur of music. i like so many different bands and kinds of music it's hard to even narrow it down. there are too many good things in life to favorite just one. lately i have been listening to a lot of ebo taylor, sixto rodriguez, the velvet underground. the black keys (anything before \"brothers\"), charles bradley, tom waits, wayne hancock. i usually go to sleep listening to classical music. have any suggestions?  food: in order; indian/afghani, thai, mexican, american. i also really love weird concoctions of lots of good stuff in one pot or pan. sex (imagine that) whiskey music (my version of sex, drugs and rock n roll) showers my cat your mom more things than one mind can handle. or can it? out somewheres. is that i have a profile and spend entirely too much time on okcupid. message me if you want to teach and learn from one another and try to live the good life most of us strive to achieve. why be somebody you are not? i like to be upfront and blunt so that there are no misconceptions about who i am. message me if you feel the same. message me if you'd like to just hang out and see where the wind takes things.\n",

      "i'm a very active, driven kind of person. i would describe myself as genuine, adventurous and loyal. i've been to and seen a lot in the world. i've had a lot of up's and down's (who hasn't?) and choose to make the most of every day.  as far as interests, i love checking out live music, dining with friends, hiking, and distance running. i like the sf food scene, and i'm one of those people that has to check out that new peruvian-asian-fusion-omg-place. but i also like cooking a home cooked meal, with a lot of e for effort and l for love. i took a day cooking course in marrakesh, morocco and learned how to cook tajine, tomato salad, pastilla, -- maybe i can fix you up something zesty?  i'm looking for someone that's a bit of a softie, cool to be around, can get along with the buddies, and... can get funky on the dance floor ??!?!? chemistry is important, and so is trust and communication. let's check out more of the city, have some fun and laughs over some cocktails. i work in the tech industry as an engineer. you really can't throw a rock down the street without hitting three of us. or three hipsters. i'd prefer the latter. i love what i do, and i want to strike out in the world with the skills that i have. traveling. i love getting my passport stamped. i've had the pleasure of living and working in australia for 4 years. the ex-pat thing was a challenging yet amazing experience. i still keep in touch with some amazing friends i made over there. not sure, my smile? radiohead, sigur ros, stevie wonder, game of thrones, mad men, sushi, california cuisine family, good friends, npr, traveling, iphone, and running shoes how to get the most out of my day, where i want my career to go and how to get there, how to fit in another run! dining out with friends, checking out music, maybe relaxing i'm a bit of sci-fi / fantasy geek. i like things like dune, game of thrones, lord of the rings, hunger games, and firefly. you'd like to see if there's chemistry\n",
      "i am a young 45 looking for my next life partner to share fun, adventure and passion with while also living in a peaceful, respectful and supportive relationship.  i am divorced, but maintain a strong friendship with my ex-wife as we co-parent our 2 sons, ages 8 and 4 1/2. i'm looking for a woman who will love me completely and also support me and join me in parenting my sons. don't get me wrong, i'm not looking for a mom for my kids. i don't need help parenting, but i would want you to want to co-parent with me. it's a package deal.  i love live music and dancing at shows and music festivals. the grateful dead and anything else jerry garcia was involved with are my favorite music, although i also love string cheese incident, yonder mountain string band, hot buttered rum, alo, railroad earth and many others. my favorite new band is nicki bluhm and the gramblers. introduce me to more. we should love going out together, but be open to each other going out separately too.  i've been to burning man 4 times, and i can't wait to go back this year! if you've never been, i'd love to take you. if you have, let's go together. i'm definitely not your stereotypical \"burner\", and i love being non-typical.  i am an avid environmentalist and entrepreneur. i've run my own green businesses for ten years in finance and real estate, and most recently in renewable energy. i love working toward saving the environment in any way i can. i would love your support and interest in what i'm doing at the end of the day. i am not a workaholic at all. i try to work smart, not just hard, leaving enough time for my kids and for you.  you have passions and dreams and the drive to fulfill your desires on your own. i would love to support you in your career too and make you dinner and give you massages at the end of long work days. we would have balance there.  we should have lots in common, but also lots to teach each other. i love to learn and i hope you do too. we should be curious together and challenge each other's predetermined notions or fears.  we should love physical affection, and find true joy in giving each other pleasure, even if just cuddling and kissing and lovingly touching each other.  i would love you to be at least vegetarian. vegan would be great, but not necessary. my sons are not vegan, but they are vegetarian. eating is a big part if life after all.  i hope you are progressive in your politics and are a politically aware person. you don't need to be a political junkie, but it would be great to be able to have conversations about what our government is doing, and how we can influence it positively. i think the occupy wall street movement is amazing. it gives me lots of hope for this country.  finally, we need to both be motivated to stay healthy and in shape. i've done triathlons before, but we don't need to get that crazy. bike rides around marin are great fun. i've rediscovered yoga recently and love the teacher i've found in sf. it's so important to stay healthy and active, especially with 2 boys growing up to keep up with.  so, i hope i've covered everything. i'm sure i've left out some things, but i know i hit the big ones. i'm a complex guy, but full of love and smiles and fun at the core. i can't wait to learn all about you!  chris i am a green business entrepreneur. i've started 2 green businesses and still run one of them after 10 years. most recently i am working on financing large scale renewable energy projects (solar, wind, biomass, etc.). very exciting that so much renewable energy generation is being built in this country finally. of course we need so much more.  i want to maximize my impact on saving the planet from human induced climate change. there's too much work to do, and i want to do as much as i can. it's definitely my life's mission.  i'm a huge fan of paul hawken, william mcdonough and amory lovins in the green business space, and bill mckibben is doing amazing work spreading awareness of the climate change issue with 350.org.  if you're in this space at all, we will be at least fast friends! i tend to be good at lots of things, but not a particular master of any one thing.  i love being a dad and i think i'm pretty great at it. my boys' mom would agree as would my friends and family. everything from teaching them about life, exposing them to culture and music and nature, playing with them and officiating during fights over toys or whatever. it's sometimes the most challenging yet certainly the most rewarding thing i've ever done.  i'm a great connector, and love networking and putting people together to make things happen. i've dedicated my life to ensuring business plays a role in correcting the damage that business has done to this planet.  i'm a good listener and excellent communicator. i'm very affectionate and sensual and i love cuddling, touching, kissing, holding hands, and would always want that with my partner. i'm very affectionate with my boys and my dog too. we always hug each other and hold hands, and i love to carry my 4 1/2 year old. i pick up the 8 year old too, but those days are numbered.  i play the guitar very casually, and i can follow along with a jam session, but i'm not the best at leading the jam or leading the camp fire sing along.  i'm a strong mountain biker, but again, not super hard core. after living in marin for 2 years i finally made it to the top of mt. tam. my 8 year old made it up to phoenix lake with me recently. i was so proud of him!  i love trying new things too, so let's see what we're good at together! my smile and my genuine interest in the people i meet. my love for my boys and how much fun i have being a dad. i've been vegan for 15 years primarily because of the environmental impact of the meat and dairy industries. local organic food is very important to me too. i love thai and indian food and a good veggie burrito. i also like to cook at home. i'm no gourmet, but i've got a killer kung pao recipe.  live music has been a huge part of my life. i love the grateful dead, string cheese incident, yonder mountain string band, railroad earth, and most jam band oriented bands - bluegrass, funk, rock, some electronic (eoto, sts9, etc.). anything that makes me dance. i also love rat pack era music, especially sinatra, broadway musicals, pink floyd, led zeppelin, metallica, black sabbath, the beatles and most classic rock. i love burning man, but not so much for the electronic music. although, a few recent experiences with ecstatic dance have opened my mind to good dj's too. honestly, i need some new music in my life. turn me on to what you're into!  i love movies. i have so many rated 5 stars on netflix that there are way too many to list. both my parents were actors, so maybe it's in my blood. it's been really fun to relive the star wars and harry potter movies with my sons lately.  with my current long commute, i've discovered audiobooks, and love them so far. i finished the millennium trilogy (girl with the dragon tattoo, etc), hitchhikers' guide to the galaxy, the alchemist, and the way of the superior man. loved all of those. zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance was really fun in a deep soul searching sort of way, especially with regard to the father/son theme throughout it. 11-22-63 was a fantastic sci-fi time travel book by steven king. any suggestions for more for me? i've also loved tom robbins, richard bach, daniel quinn, and more recently eckhart tolle. i also read a lot of news and non-fiction, and that's usually online in newsletters, or on blogs or web sites. i read a lot about green business, renewable energy and progressive politics.  i rarely watch tv, except for the daily show and real time with bill maher. i try to never miss either of those. colbert can be fun too. i'm also in awe of chris hedges, cornell west, tavis smiley, michael moore and others on political and social justice issues, and catch them on tv whenever i can. 1. my 2 boys 2. love 3. great friends 4. live music 5. my bike 6. my guitar global warming and the climate crisis we are in. our interconnectedness and how so many people don't get that we are all connected. trying to live in the moment and not too much in the past or the future. i have my boys every other friday night, so it depends. weeks with them, they are asleep by 9 so it's maybe a movie or catch up on work. for special shows, i'll get a sitter.  when i don't have my boys, i'll go out to a show or a party with friends or maybe stay in and catch up on work and get a good night's sleep so i can get up and go for a bike ride in the morning.  when the weather is nice i might take my boys camping with friends, or for a weekend sleepover with various friends with kids. i am blessed to have many great friends in the greater bay area who have kids around the same age as my boys. i'll tell you anything and everything, but let's meet first. you're excited to date a guy with 2 awesome sons, you're vegetarian (bonus points for being vegan or vegan curious), and you're working toward making this world a better place in one way or another. looking forward to hearing from you!\n",

      "the first night with a new lover is always, always the worst sex you'll have with that person, no matter how good it is.  good love-making takes time. it requires learning subtleties of expression and sensitivity. it requires a million kinds of sensory exploration and the dedication to study everything one finds -- every tremor, every sigh, every sidelong glance -- without prejudice or preconceived notion. more than anything else, it requires probing a lover's mind and opening the closed doors inside. good love-making is a science and an art; a process and a goal; and it's the only kind i ever want to pursue. i'd rather be celibate than compromise that standard. i've been living the consequence of that preference since i moved to this coastline ... and, well, that's why i'm here on okc.  i am a graduate student at stanford university. i don't think i deserve to be here, but i'm doing my best to earn my place. i did my undergrad at a small school in new england, and i worked in that region for four years before coming out here in september 2010.  i grew up without money, so i know that money is not necessary for happiness. since the beginning of my professional life, i have never been without money, and i will likely never lack it from here on out. that said, i do not define myself as a person of means. i have given away at least a quarter of all that i have ever earned. i live with as few possessions as possible. i shop at second-hand stores. the things that i really value cannot be purchased.  historically, i've had an unfortunate attraction to lesbians. real ones, not the fake lipstick-kind you see on the internet. independence, self-confidence, and personal strength are qualities i find hugely attractive in women, and lesbians tend to have those things in spades. all but my first two girlfriends have had at least some level of attraction to their own gender. it can be nice to have certain things in common with somebody you're seeing....  if there is such a thing as a male feminist, i am one of them. if not, then i am a feminist ally. sexism disgusts me on a very deep level. i tend to have difficulty developing friendships with men because of the continued pervasiveness of male chauvinism in our culture. for one thing (of many), i believe that the concept of chivalry is an insult to women. \"let me do for you what you obviously can't do for yourself.\" disgusting. that said, i'm not rude. i will open this door for you if you open the next one for me. if you pick up the check today, i'll get the one tomorrow. fairness, equality, in all things.  one of my close blood relatives is a fundamentalist baptist. another is wiccan. others in my family are catholic and jewish, and many are deeply entrenched in their respective beliefs. all my life, i have had to tiptoe around religious topics simply for the sake of preserving family harmony and not estranging myself from those who i have no choice but to love. when it comes to those for whom i do have that choice, however, i feel no compulsion to equivocate. i am an atheist. love comes from within, not from above. death will be the end, which is exactly why today is very, very important.  i do want children some day. i am not intentionally looking for their mother right now.  i have performed as an actor in something on the order of three dozen shows on the college, community, and professional levels. some of them were musicals, some shakespeare; some good, some bad. it's a hobby, and a fun way to exercise the half of my brain that goes mostly unused during the average working day.  at times in the past, i have engaged in multiple simultaneous open relationships. this is not by any means to say that i am not (or have ever been not) looking for love or commitment. i most certainly am. it is simply that, in my personal history, neither sex nor love have absolutely necessitated exclusivity. getting my ass kicked by classes at one of the best universities in the world (at which i am utterly baffled to find myself).  searching for people who can introduce me to new things in life to love. asking questions. getting people to talk. writing too much. dreaming. (i try to practice as much as possible.) i am tall, and i am very bald.  on that last point: i have had the hair on my head removed -- burned off -- by means of a series of laser treatments. soon that baldness will be perfect (no shadow at all, ever) and permanent.  even as a kid, i was always fascinated by elective, permanent body alteration. piercings, tattoos, and ... many things much more intense. yes, your body is your temple. decorate appropriately. on all counts, i feel that i am under-exposed. and on all counts, i like things that make me think, things that are intricate and subtle and surprising.  here is a list of fifty books i've read in the last few years. some were guilty pleasures; some were returns to childhood. some i liked a lot; some i hated with an intense burning passion. you may find one or two in the list that you hate ... don't judge me by them, 'cause i might hate them too. i make a big effort sometimes to expose myself to ideologies and viewpoints that i don't necessarily agree with simply so that i can become knowledgeable of them.:  1984; animal farm; anthem; the art of war; atlas shrugged; basic economics: a citizen's guide to the economy; bonk: the curious coupling of science and sex; born to run: a hidden tribe, superathletes, and the greatest race the world has never seen; capitalism: the unknown ideal; chapterhouse: dune; children of dune; a christmas carol; death by black hole: and other cosmic quandaries; don juan; dracula; dune; dune messiah; emma; the ethical slut: a practical guide to polyamory, open relationships & other adventures; freakonomics: a rogue economist explores the hidden side of everything; the fountainhead; god emperor of dune; the great gatsby; gulliver's travels; harry potter i through vi; heart of darkness; heretics of dune; homage to catalonia; hunters of dune; the invisible man; jane eyre; the jungle; paradise lost; the picture of dorian gray; the political brain: the role of emotion in deciding the fate of the nation; a portrait of the artist as a young man; robinson crusoe; sandworms of dune; siddhartha; the snows of kilimanjaro; the stranger; tess of the d'urbervilles; uncle tom's cabin; walden; why evolution is true surprise. tenacity. detail. focus. obsessiveness. eloquence. how improper expectations can ruin just about any experience. ways to preserve navet and eschew preconceived notions. gender as a social construct. cunnilingus. whether or not i'm really going to be able to hack it at this school. what i should do before i die. the nature of love. how it might be for an openly polyamorous couple to raise children, and whether it'd really be any different for the kids than having parents who were divorced and seeing other people. acrobatic sex. non-monetary means by which people communicate how much they value other people. exactly how many dozens of orgasms a human person can endure in one day. recently: studying. i've been kind-of a shut-in. not cool. time to change that. i was raised by a schizophrenic woman and a male cross-dresser. my childhood was very different from yours. my ideologies and sensitivities are very different than those of the average heterosexual, middle-class, american male. ...you live close by. like it or not, the first and foremost factor determining the practicality of any relationship is geographical convenience. if you're a ten minute walk across campus, i don't care if our match percentage is relatively low, i'd still like to meet you.  and/or: ...our match percentage is high. i believe wholeheartedly in the statistical algorithm that produces those numbers. i've met a few people through this site with whom i shared match percentages in the high 90's, and all of them were people with whom i sensed the potential for some kind of love (be it romantic or platonic). if you match with me 95% or above, i'd probably take three trains and a bus just to meet you for coffee.  and/or: ...you know what \"compersion\" is. i wasn't introduced to the word until my mid 20's, and i was simply relieved to finally have a means by which to communicate something i'd felt all my life.\n",

      "bay area born and raised, with a brief stint in santa fe, i assumed i had become one of those thin skinned types who freaked at 50 degrees and thought i had died and gone to hell when it hit 85. so naturally i fell (ha) for ice climbing. when it's considered toasty warm to have 15 in the canyon.  the karmic exchange for so much joy is that the season is short - thus balancing out joy vs pain - but the two months of bliss a year are worth it. blue, hard, unpredictable, high altitude, ice climbing is all about finding that thing ... but i digress.  the obscure, challenging, odd, quirky and funny fascinate me. i guess my bay area background has molded me into being other. if everyone walks down the middle of the hall, i am the one who walks the margins, just to balance things out. plus it's totally entertaining to rock climb along corporate hallways, sideways, and with no protection! i wonder, during the course of the day, why rasputin? why was he so trusted and consequently responsible for the premature (one could argue) demise of a regime? what truly happens in a black hole, and if string theory is correct, darn it's hard to imagine dimensions 5 to 11 (you try it).  also wonder how in the world the artist who painted the long mural in the nijo castle (kyoto) came up with the idea the theme of \"squares\" - it's so odd and captivating. kyoto has amazing ryokans, and nothing like a hot bath in a cedar tub sucks.  seriously, enjoying my job, friends and family. life here in the bay area is nothing short of spectacular. wondering at times whether i will ever meet the one - and in the meantime, having fun trying --- lots of great adventures to be had, and i'm all in for that! .... so here i am with my life in san francisco, so, why not, sushi, tonight, with a nice locally brewed ipa or an unfiltered sake? (although my go to is red wine, for now...) while listening to nikki minaj's starships, iron and wine or the brilliance of dan tepfer...  more urbane than suburban, more this is crazy than same ol same ol, more, let's go out and do something fun than netflicks (although currently loving the borgias...) love to fantasize, free associate and eat french fries (and apparently alliteration). experimenting (frustrated chemist/bartender).  bright spring colors make me smile, and i'm really good at throwing a wardrobe together that match the colors outside. the sweet smell of chicken teriyaki being barbequed. watching the heat waves bounce off asphalt. the perfect hat and high heels. fuzzy anything.  i am really really good at making the guy i am with very happy - i an attentive, passionate, considerate, energetic, and devoted. part of it is cultural, part of it is that giving makes me feel good. receving is not so bad, either. my wry sense of humor. my smile. my positive attitude - i believe that \"like attracts like\" and i like to be and attract kind, healthy, spiritual, smart and fun people who like to think \"slow.\" on my bookpile - thinking fast and slow, last's sunday's nyt, the odyssey. some trashy novel. almonds in olive oil and smart water make me really happy. eggs. people on the far right side of the bell curve. compassion. singing. whether we truly need another reality show. and do the kardashians really exist? have you ever seen them in person? see what i mean?  world peace. saving whales. usually from some bar stool. that i love bowling. a night at seabowl in pacifica is so much fun, and one of my favorite items of clothing is my (new) seabowl t shirt. you're sincere, smart, healthy, emotionally self aware, happy and love to laugh. please, i'm really not into b calls or drive bys. !  you want to.  my motto: stay classy, san diego!\n",

      "very busy lately. looking forward to some time away from work to have some fun outdoors. i've been designing and sewing bike related bags and backpacks for different companies since 2006. i'm working on starting my own brand and expanding to camping gear in general.  i cycle a lot, and started camping by bicycle last year. i try to bike-camp about once every two weeks. i recently became a member of a local sailing club, and try to get on the water whenever i have a chance. honestly? procrastinating. but, i'm also pretty good at making stuff out of fabric, creating entire stories out of thin air, comedic timing and starting fires. (like camp fires) that i look young for my age. right now my favorite book is \"a dance with dragons\", it comes out this month and it's the fifth in a series i've been addicted to since december 2010. i also love \"been down so long it looks like up to me\" \"tiger, tiger\" and \"the once and future king\". i read a lot of bad pulp science fiction, but i also read some good science fiction.  \"who's afraid of virginia woolf?\" is my all time favorite movie. i'm also a big fan of \"naked\" (mike leigh), \"withnail & i\", \"mystery train\", \"raising arizona\", \"rushmore\" and lot's of others.  i love food, just about all types of food. all it has to be, is made well. soul food is among my favorites, bbq chicken, greens, mac n cheese... love indian food, dim sum, italian seafood, mexican seafood, funnel cake, ice cream, sushi, carnitas tacos ... etc. for whatever reason i don't really like ethiopian food. i don't hate it, i'm just not a big fan. i'm also not real big on most pizza.  music... i like a lot of stuff. all time favorites are lou reed, brian eno, sonic youth, smiths, the cure, dead can dance, run dmc, cocteau twins, prince, marc bolan, roxy music, wire, swell maps ... a lot of 70's punk/glam and 80's punk/goth, but i like almost everything else too.  over the past few years, i've been into a place to bury strangers, crystal castles, crystal stilts, the pink industry, the soft moon, spank rock, santigold, girl talk, yeah yeah yeahs, biff bang pow!, colin newman, the supremes. very lately, i've been getting into \"witch house\", bands like  (ritualz), pictureplane, and ooooo. i just discovered zola jesus, which reminds me of souxsie and the banshees. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vywhi0ug7pq stories (books/movies) music caffeine a pair of working legs back yard barbecues the outdoors (not necessarily in that order) evolution & bag design. if i got out of work early enough, i'm camping. otherwise, i'm at the berkeley marina, either learning on a dinghy, or out on a night cruise that a friend put together. if i'm not camping or sailing, and none of my friends invited me to a back yard bbq, i'm probably at home watching a movie. (though i might have taken my projector to a friends back yard to show a movie for folks) in person i would probably admit more personal stuff, but online... i guess there was the time i was visiting a friend in nyc, and the vet called to tell me my dog was seriously ill. i won't go into details, but they recommended putting her to sleep, and i agreed. i was walking through manhattan bawling. it was a day before my birthday. tmi? you prefer to hang with people outdoors, you find that bars are kind of a drag unless there's a really good band playing (and the bar has an out door area to escape the crowd), you find that some tv shows are good, but a campfire with friends is still more fun to stare at, you've grown out of wild raging parties, but haven't grown out of having fun.\n",

      "i've been in san francisco for almost 3 years and i can't imagine living anywhere else right now. i'm always discovering new things in the city. i have a goal of trying at least one new place each week. now that the weather's starting to get nice, i've been trying to do more outdoor activities.  i love food! i'm always trying new dishes and types of food. i'm still figuring out the whole cooking thing, so my culinary adventures usually happen at restaurants. every year, i try to go through the 7x7 big eat list. i have yet to complete it all, but at least it provides a lot of suggestions. living and working in san francisco. i work downtown making apps for smartphones and tablets. i love my job, but i focus more on the living aspect and try to leave work at work.  amateur photographer - take that with a grain of salt. i don't know the technical aspects of photography. i just like to take pictures of things that are cool or interesting. i post my favorites on my flickr page: http://www.flickr.com/photos/cacuzcatlan  attempting to cook. i'm still learning, but i think i do alright in the kitchen. recipe apps make it easy to plan ahead, buy ingredients, and cook something new each week. lately, i've been trying to cook more salvadoran food with my mom's recipes.  i've started to do more travelling recently, after years of just talking about it. i went to el salvador last year and i'm going to turkey and greece later this year. - getting around on public transit - parallel parking while driving stick shift i always wear a watch. books: i don't read as many book as i'd like to, but i'm working on improving that. - kitchen confidential - a people's history of the united states - freakonomics - the ball is round  movies: - the usual suspects - city of god - lord of war - love actually  shows: the wire is the greatest show that has ever been on television! - the daily show - the colbert report - anthony bourdain's shows (no reservations & the layover) - treme  music: mostly underground hip hop, but i try to branch out and check out all genres - rhymesayers (atmosphere, brother ali, p.o.s.) - blackstar - the roots - kid cudi - social distortion - the slackers - refused - manu chao currently listening to: dead combo  food: - persian - salvadoran - mexican - thai - coffee / tea i'm willing to try anything. recent favorite: troya  brenda's french soul food is the best brunch in sf. i challenge you to find something better. 1. family/friends 2. a french press (and coffee to go with it) 3. delicious food 4. music 5. smartphone 6. hot sauce - tapatio and sriracha where to park my car to avoid street cleaning tickets. getting as far away from work as possible. i sometimes coordinate the color of my underwear to match my clothes. you want to explore the city\n",

      "i find it difficult to describe myself on a \"profile\" in any manner that doesn't seem cheesy or overly pretentious. i find quantifying my personality into discrete categories of interests and checklists that are then tabulated to access my acceptability through a profiling algorithm to be challenging, disingenuous, and vaguely troublesome, while it excludes the potential for intimate connections to arise genuinely. alas i will say that i am a man who used to write love songs... then got to caught up writing love songs to remember to fall in love again. i am open to the possibilities in life, and start every day with an earnest desire to be amazed, to approach life with a humble heart and accept things that come. i express myself through music, dance, and other physical dynamic poetry such as soccer, basketball, an invented skills contest amongst friends, or drumming. as i write this it occurs to me, i mean an intimate connection rhythm and movement... i'm a beat producer/ composer trying to write beautiful music, that inspires and liberates something intangible within us all. i'm trying to be continually surprised and amazed by what life offers while becoming the man i always wanted to be. dancing, soccer, and writing experimental soul music and experiments in the folkish electronic. thats a question better asked of someone who knows me. i suppose it would be my passion or my rye sense of humor. favorite book... either the wind-up bird chronicle by murakami, or 100 years of solitude, by gabriela garcia marquez. current favorite music - james blake or kanye west instrumentals. mount kimbie -my computer -my drum machine -love -my friends -a good book -my aspirations and goals my music, cultural relationships to art and music. my relationship to commerce and consumption. how to find balance in my life. at home writing beats. i am my own worst enemy. you want...\n",
      "so far, this does not by any means capture who i am, but it is a work in progress!  i am sensitive, intellectually curious (at times insatiably so), artistic, intelligent, quiet but vibrantly alive, sometimes rather introverted, sometimes a deep thinker, sometimes utterly silly, often passionate, and very confused about what meaning we can give to our lives.  i am a former lawyer who really wished to be a writer who remains a perpetual student of things too esoteric to be practical. i am an animal lover. i am recently divorced. long ago, i was an art school drop-out, and i have been having trouble finding the right place for myself ever since. i am also intensely physical when i am in a good relationship.  some of the things i love doing: taking long walks almost everywhere, hiking, being at or even near the ocean, witnessing nature in all its venues, exploring new places, casual bird-watching, losing track of time in bookstores or libraries, shopping at farmers' markets, finding surprising new places to get a good meal.  i also love pondering, discussing, and writing about evolution, language, animals, moral philosophy, serious literature and art, legal philosophy, etc.  i have very broad interests and spend a lot of time reading and learning about a rich variety of things and incorporating them as fodder for my creative imagination. someone i know once described her own mind as \"fertile but untidy.\" well, my mind is positively fecund--and although many of those ideas are destined to be pushed out of the nest by their stronger siblings, it is also a pretty well-organized mind due to time spent studying and practicing law and analytic philosophy.  some things i have not yet done, but about which i have high hopes for the future: hike the lost coast; learn to kayak; attend a chimposium at wsu (where the captive chimps communicate using sign language); become a volunteer dog walker at an animal shelter; visit new zealand, the galapagos islands, alaska; fall deeply in love again and this time know enough to make it last; be surprised by being introduced to new interests i had never even considered. like my profile, i am definitely a work in progress. i've never found a job that was completely satisfying, so i am now in a phd program, very late in life, trying to figure out what i want to do before it is time to retire. this gives me a lot of time, while i am procrastinating, to think, to write fiction, and to take long walks. i am also trying to heal from my recent divorce, and to reconcile myself to my role in the dissolution of my marriage so that i can try not to make the same mistakes again. i am very bad at acknowledging that i am \"really good\" at anything, but i am pretty good at writing, at listening in conversations, at reasoning, at cooking vegan food. i have no idea--i've never asked and people have rarely volunteered this information (other than to point out on the street that i could afford to smile). i learn a lot about life, the world, and human nature form literature, so the list of those to whom i am particularly indebted is long. my favorite authors/books: * thomas mann (my absolute favorite novel is \"the magic mountain,\" but then there is also \"the holy sinner\") * a.s. byatt * nadine gordimer * j.m. coetzee (especially the animal questions) * kafka * henry james * goethe's \"faust\" and some others * sophocles * aeschylus * flannery o'connor * \"the little prince\" * eugene o'neill * joyce carol oates * \"the god of small things\" * plus nietzsche, kant, hobbes, vicki hearne, and numerous other philosophers * a lot of cultural and biological anthropology (my favorite among these: \"nuclear rites\" or \"the symbolic species: the coevolution of language and the brain\")  my favorite directors/movies: * tarkovsky (especially \"andrei rublev\") * bresson * kurosawa (especially \"the lower depths\" and \"the idiot\") * bergman * everything involving david attenborough * dreyer * schlondorff * ozu * mizoguchi's \"ugetsu\" * truffaut's \"the 400 blows\" * christopher guest * wes anderson * \"harold and maude\" * \"breakfast at tiffany's\"  my favorite music is harder to specify. i love bach and early polyphonic music, and sometimes very much enjoy brahms, beethoven, or wagner. i also like, but in a trivial way, a lot of pop music from my youth, due to its ability to reactivate those old feelings.  my absolute favorite food is pizza (though it is almost impossible to find a good one in the bay area), followed by cuisines with lots of vegetables, and sometimes tending toward macrobiotic. when i am not searching for good pizza, i am a mostly-vegan ethical vegetarian, so i prefer vegetable-oriented ethnic cuisines. middle eastern/mediterranean food is probably my favorite among these, since i can never get too much hummus. i also enjoy cooking, and try to make everything as organic and locally grown as possible. this is difficult, but i would say: reading writing being near the ocean love and sex (though i suppose that is really two) encountering other species (including my cats) is there a meaning to human life? is there any way to be compassionate and behave ethically in our world? how much do other animals think? what makes great art? can i become capable of making even good art? what will i do if i have to leave the california coast and get used to east coast weather again? does the language we speak shape our cognition? how can we possibly apologize to the rest of the inhabitants of the planet for what humanity has done to it? am i lovable? will i be lovable when i get older? why can't i convince my male cat to urinate in the litter box--am i a bad parent? in other words, the big questions. having dinner with one or two friends; watching a video; taking a walk; perhaps just sitting at home reading. often thinking about how much nicer it is to be able to spend friday nights with someone special. first, filling out this profile feels like an enormous violation of privacy. second, i am currently in psychoanalysis, because i need it (but don't many of us?). you think you might enjoy getting to know someone like me.\n",

      "i recently tried an experiment where i wrote a fairly detailed history of my entire life's trajectory here...it was not a success. so here's the short and vague version:  i'm a musician/writer/engineer/entrepreneur. i'm left-handed. i love listening to, and creating, music. when someone tells me they are a dj, a small part of me dies. i love challenges. i have an edge, yet am also a boy scout who helps old ladies across the street. i'm spiritual, and have an aversion for dogma. i'm originally from chicago, as in \"3-1-2\". i'm well-traveled...let's just say that i learned foreign languages out of necessity. female co-workers once described me as \"the epitome of tall, dark, handsome, and mysterious\".  if i told you any more, i would no longer be so mysterious! i'm the founder of a startup that helps individuals and emerging brands get heard on social media. this is how i spend the vast majority of my time.  playing music. my apartment is full of musical instruments. i love vintage guitars, amps, and analog synthesizers. once in a while i get tapped as a sideman for someone's show...and i even perform solo on occasion.  i stay fit doing yoga and other aerobics. i like riding my bicycle to my office in soma. it's great being able to integrate exercise in to the course of a normal day. not to mention the adrenaline factor of bicycle commuting during sf rush hour. update: my bicycle was stole...i view the event simply as an opportunity to buy a new one. that's just how i roll. asking for what i want. honoring my commitments. arriving on time. take note, i am actually 6'4\". so typically they notice a head bobbing above a sea of other, less compelling heads. for music i enjoy chill beats, like massive attack, thievery corporation, and air. i also have a soft spot for dream pop, shoegaze, postrock, etc. the last new band i discovered is beach house. deadheads, please move along quietly...nothing to see here. while they had a few great songs, in general, i cringe when i hear them.  at one time i considered myself well read, however i have little time to read fiction any more. my reading is primarily work-related, with the exception of tapeop magazine, which i could never give up. recently, a neighbor dumped a copy of \"eat, pray, love\" in the foyer and for some reason i picked it up. it now lies unread in my apartment. apparently, its presence here indicates that i am sensitive.  i'm a member of the san francisco film society, and love quirky indie films as well as schlockbusters.  i don't have cable or broadcast tv, but i watch a few shows on hulu, notably steven colbert and jon stewart. i also love mad men, game of thrones, walking dead, archer, big bang theory, and community. i won't waste time thinking about scarcity. here are six things i can never get enough of:  my daily morning coffee...bearing in mind that \"morning\" is relative being around interesting, positive people learning and personal growth interesting challenges bandwidth kisses the interconnectedness of everything. friday night i observe a personal ritual that i developed some years ago. it's about honoring the accomplishments of the week, and reflecting on the current state of my life. i call it \"steak night\".  i prefer boneless rib-eye, with a couple of glasses of a hearty cabernet. up until june 11, 2012, i had a cat. she passed away due to cancer after 16 happy years together. my heart is a little broken right now. you are \"adorkable\". you believe \"average\" is an insult. you live near sf, or want to spend time here.\n",

      "i enjoy the company of people who are discreetly inappropriate. i'm goofy but only when i'm comfortable with people. i do realize though, that there is a time and place for everything. i'm considerate. i have a promising career that i actually like. i let my dog sleep on the bed with me because i love the crap out of her. my conscience weighs on me heavily which prevents me from doing things i don't morally agree with. i like nice things, so i work hard to achieve them, but in no way am i consumed with materialism. i think the older we get, the more we realize this. hopefully anyway. if i could describe myself with one word it would be conscious. i'm an old soul. what makes me cool, is i'm a genuinely good person and anyone who knows me will tell you that.  i'll secretly damn you to hell if i'm standing behind you in a 10 items or less checkout line and you have more. i enjoy staying in just as much as i like going out. for being so coordinated, i'm extremely clumsy. i wouldn't consider myself artsy but my thoughts are creative. arrogance disgusts me. i make lists for everything and i'm starting to realize i'm a little ocd in my older age.  i believe in the principle of things. i pay attention to details. i have a weakness for french fries. i need more patience. sometimes i can be pessimistic with the world and what's going on in it. one of my best friends just told me i was the sweetest asshole he's ever known. i feel cleaning is therapeutic. i'm honest, maybe too honest. i don't always want to be on good behavior. i'm very observant, and i pick up on character quickly. i'd think you're crazy if you spend $3.49 for a bottle of fiji water. i communicate well. i'm probably more expressive than most. i think i'm funny as hell. i'm jaded. i have class. i exercise and have a healthy diet. i've been told i have a quiet confidence about myself. i vote democratic all the way. trying to do the right thing. making people laugh at my own expense. building stuff. frisbee. eye contact. forgetting the names of people i just met. finding useless non verified information on the internet. my job. breaking things down logically. being a contributing member to society. admitting when i'm wrong. my personality of course! well either that, or my huge breasts. books- textbooks, blueprints. i'm a sucker for any spiritual or healthy living readings. the greatest book i've ever read is shantaram. i don't think i'll ever read another that can compare.  movies- high fidelity, when harry met sally. mainly into foreign or comedy films.  music- i like music i can sing along to. love it all, just depends on my mood.  shows- big bang theory, martin, family guy, lockup, judge judy (she is a beast!), kqed.  food- i prefer a good neighborhood hole in the wall restaurant. mexican, korean, indian, mediterranean, american. burritos exercise burtsbees chapstick. humor music drive i spend a lot of time thinking about things that i find valuable, which seem to change all the time. how to balance work, school, chores, and the gym with going out and being social. i have to be honest, it's hard. maybe i'm just bad at time management. probably not doing something really really cool. i've read some other peoples answers to this, and i think they're lying. i like john mayer but i don't want the guys at work to find out.  when i wake up in the middle of the night i sit down to pee because i'm too tired to stand. your pictures don't consist of you showing an abnormally large amount of cleavage. (thats why you're not meeting any normal people) message me if you're confident enough not to take yourself too seriously. all your friends aren't the same ethnicity. you realize there are other important things in this world besides yourself. you want to ride bikes with me. you're down to earth and considerate. you're humble. message me if your thought process is more emotional and less mechanical. you own a pair of onitsuka tigers. you're physically and mentally healthy. you're curious. you don't smoke. you're funny. you have something important or extremely ridiculous to say. you want to make fun of me or something i said. you don't go to the bar every weekend. you have similar views. i'm looking for an equal. a running and/or activity partner would be cool too. in no way would i expect all of this from a person but these are the qualities i like in my friends. i'd like to meet some good people with no pressure for intimacy and let things happen naturally.\n",
      "seesee: born and raised in daly city, love my mommy and dadskies. i have 3 sisters.  i have amazing friends who i love dearly. to me they are not only amazing compared to all the people i know personally, but to all people in life - period.  i am a bruin for life. ucla undergrad was one of my favorite periods in my nearly 30 years of living. i will do the 8-clap on command.  i teach. i've taught preschool and currently teach elementary school. i've taught in south la, harlem, and now in the bayview neighborhood in sf.  where i've taught also speaks to where i've lived. although i won't ever be a true new yorker or los angeleno (because i am a daly city girl at heart), whenever i go to those places i always feel at home due to all the wonderful friends and family i have there.  i also do not pass up any opportunity to travel, whether it be to explore a new neighborhood in sf or to nicaragua to hike up mount telica and camp on the side of a volcano. as of this very moment i am on summer break taking care of all that good stuff i don't really get to while i'm running around with my 1st graders during the school year.  good stuff includes, but is not limited to: purging miscellaneous stuff i've been meaning to donate or get rid of, picking up my dusty guitar and practicing the 5 chords i know to attempt to sing and play taylor swift songs, reading random novels and the yahoo articles that are featured on its homepage, running and bicycling around the neighborhood, and helping my dear friend with peripheral wedding planning, oh and watching the \"insanity\" infomercial at least once a day. whistling through my teeth, remembering details of stories people tell about their lives and then surprising them with my memory when i refer to those stories later in conversation, starting but not finishing novels but also getting into other novels so much that i read them until 3am, singing disney songs, not laughing at kids when they do or say things that would make the average adult crack up in order to maintain my authority, and finishing my food at the dinner table. i don't have much of a chin. i like lots of different books/movies/shows/music/food. i also like to try different books/movies/shows/music/food. got any suggestions?  right now i'm really into reading about adam yauch's (mca) life, sarah dessen teen-fiction novels, listening to raphael saadiq's the way i see it album and taylor swifts's songs from the hunger games soundtrack, watching christian bale movies, eating oatmeal and doughnuts, and watching girls, revenge and shows that they offer on-demand on comcast cable that i didn't follow in the fall that i sort of wanted to but didn't (like new girl and workaholics). other than the given 3 f's (friends, family, food) -  1) music 2) the sense of hearing to go with #1 3) flamin' hot cheetos 4) laughter 5) an over-sized and uber comfy hoodie 6) the beach while wearing flip-flops or barefoot how can i get these little guys to stay in their rug spots? how can i keep these little guys focused for more than 3 minutes? why is t nibbling on that red crayon?  but lately it's been more like, how can i make my summer days productive and fun and not spend all of my money in the process? @ happy hour with friends from work, passed out on the couch, or relaxing on a friend's couch watching a netflix movie or a dvr'ed show we need to catch up on and drinking a beer. i pooped my pants in 1st grade because at the time i was painfully shy and too scared to ask my teacher to use the bathroom because she said that it was absolutely not an option to use the bathroom during the state cat test. she was also 157 years old, had white hair, wore pink lipstick and scared the begeezus out of me. my apu (grandma) had to be called to pick me up. i was so completely embarrassed. it hasn't happened since though, i swear. you've endured and actually read this far. if you really want to. if you're a genuinely good-natured person (not only cuz your mama or papa says you are).\n",

(prerequisites to being awesome: you are nice to everyone. you and your friends think you're fun. you know what it feels like to laugh so hard that you're afraid of passing out...and you loved the feeling.)  -bonus points if: you like rock climbing, own a sail boat, or have access to a pool.\n",

      "third-year at cal, studying environmental science and peace and conflict studies. despite my majors, i haven't turned into a hippie...unless i have and haven't realized it...  i like people, places, and things. i also like making references to things and then pointing them out so that people will understand how witty i am. uh huh. i like to think that i do whatever makes me happy, as long as it fits within my ethical framework. that's why i gave up meat - it was delicious, but it didn't make sense to casually advocate for something so cruel just for a few seconds of taste.  career-wise, i've been considering going further into the environmental consulting industry. or, i just might take a foray into the food industry. my friends have told me that i could sell my homemade ice creams and start a business out of it. inserting incredibly random facts into a conversation. ask me the capital of (almost) any country, or about some random dish from some obscure country. i read wikipedia for fun!  i am also good at: - falling asleep in public. funny story: i hit a lady on bart by accident once, as my friends were trying to wake me up and i was swatting their hands away. my flailing arm ended up hitting a woman's face. that made for an awkward bart ride... - excessively using ellipses, parentheses and dashes, sometimes inappropriately and oftentimes in school papers...how i get away with it, i don't know. - not blinking (i've won every single staring contest i've ever been in. my theory is that my small eyes are harder to dry out than other peoples' eyes. win!) - doing romance readings with playing cards ;d - trivia - being on jeopardy! is something that will happen some day - using my gaydar. seriously, it rarely fails me. except for that one time at a club...that was a sad night. i don't actually believe that there's an objective way to tell whether someone's gay or not by looking at them, but there's always visual cues: eye contact, etc. for some reason, people also seem to think that i'm lost or confused all the time. confused, maybe. lost, sometimes (i'll never admit it). daydreaming - often.  someone also once told me that i have judgmental eyes. i wouldn't deny that. books - east of eden, a song of fire and ice, the bell jar, great expectations, the great gatsby, 1984, the hunger games, random non-fiction. i also like reading textbooks! (really!)  movies - i need to watch more movies. pan's labyrinth, pulp fiction, 12 angry men, up in the air, the artist, how to train your dragon, crazy stupid love, safety not guaranteed, wall-e.  music - i'm into an eclectic mix of music. a sample: vienna teng (my favorite), yeah yeah yeahs, m83, camera obscura, kelly clarkson, bon iver, shakira, kanye west, santigold, thao nguyen, ellie goulding, guster, janelle monae, kt tunstall, laura marling, lykke li, m. ward, metric, sigur ros, vampire weekend, the xx  food - anything. i have a huge food lover, so i love to try all sorts of different foods. give me something strange, and if it's edible, i will try it at least once before i decide whether it's good or not. i also spend way too much time trying to cook complicated things that a college student should not be attempting...i swear, it is my downfall. 1. foodfoodfoodfood 2. gmail (google calendar is the structure of my life. and don't get me started on google docs) 3. wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lists_of_lists_of_lists 4. music - both playing and listening. 5. school (and not ashamed of it) 6. my beloved samsung qx810 laptop! no apple products for me, though i'm not vehemently anti-apple. interesting ice cream flavors. the classics are always great, but i love coming across flavors that i've never seen before. the tequila gelato from a few months back still haunts my dreams. i got a neat little secondhand cuisinart ice cream maker a few months back and have been busy making batches of ice cream!  and people - they're funny, aren't they? i'm not too good at making plans, so whatever i do on friday nights usually come up spontaneously. this can include: eating, partying, clubbing, board gaming, cooking, going to a concert, (studying, though i'm denying that), sleeping, gaming (super smash brothers/skyrim, generally)... i don't like feet. ...you've even thought about it. i don't bite...usually.\n",
      "perhaps i am brutally honest or maybe i just lack social graces, but i tend not to play games. actually, i have no clue how to play games when dating, so what you see is what you get. i probably won't try to impress you or stroke your ego if i don't agree with you. i have a terrible poker face.  fairness is very important to me, and i am not impressed with material goods. i am more impressed by humble, educated guys than big muscles, big houses, expensive clothes, or fancy cars...but feel free to shower me with gifts if you must!  when i'm not working, i enjoying going to cultural festivals, cooking classes, or hiking. i am not big on fighting crowds so i tend to stay away from events where i can't get in and out of bart without elbowing people.  i love going to movies, going out for a meal, or having coffee and reading or playing scrabble in a coffee shop with just the right ambience. i prefer small ethnic restaurants to expensive restaurants even do i enjoy all kids of good food. i haven't traveled as much as i would like, but perhaps having a partner will change that.  i hope i haven't ruled out too many people. i will try almost anything once, but like most people our age, i have developed hobbies, interests, likes and dislikes. i am a music teacher (band and orchestra). i love my job and my students, but i am working on having more balance in my life. i hope to read more books, take more vacations, and waste more time. cooking listening sorting things on excel using mail merge managing 90 middle school kids on a field trip and other assorted talents to be revealed later i'm petite. you can put me in your pocket! i love food from anywhere on the asian continent. my guilty pleasure...sitcom re-runs, food network, hoarders, gcb, ice-hockey love classical, jazz, classic rock, classic r&b, world music books npr family coffee tea salt my next day off from work social justice limousine liberals racism and some happy things too! in my stretchy pants as soon as possible. teachers have to be \"on\" all the time. by the time i get home on friday i am useless. i am ready to go on saturday. i had to make my own \"mixed tape.\" so sad. you are kind to strangers you are liberal (financially and socially) you are financially secure (you know how to manage money) you don't smoke or use any illegal drugs you have a sense of humor you have your own hobbies, interests, and friends and are not jealous you are not a food nazi...no meat, no gluten, no dairy....jeez!\n",
      "i live over in east bay and am currently working down in san mateo in the computer entertainment industry. i find my job incredibly fulfilling, and barely see it as work. so i've got step one of my dream job, but i'm still missing something. i admit that what my life is now lacking is life away from work, which even though it includes plenty of good friends and fun outings, is still something i'd like to have some variety.  i enjoy travel and seeing other cultures and places. i've mainly been around europe and i find the food, sights, and people simply amazing. i plan on saving up for traveling throughout my life so i can continue to see more of the world.  to counter the fast-paced environment at work, i like to relax in my spare time, spending it in parks, cafes, hiking, city walking etc. when i don't feel like spending it outdoors i'm perfectly happy watching dvds at home or working on creative projects of my own.  i have a goofball sense of humor - i'm usually the first to go after a bad pun just to see everyone's reaction one second, and then impressions and random funny quotes the second. i poke fun and make sure to keep things light, a great sense of humor is key for me.  i am creative, compassionate, and fun-loving currently i'm working my way up in the computer entertainment industry, started off right after college and have been moving up ever since. other than work, i balance out my life going to clubs and bars with friends. i'm always looking to meet new and interesting people and discover some fun activities. i'm great at creative projects and when it comes to thinking of imaginative solutions to problems, i'm the brainstorm guy.  i'm also a good listener. i find people pretty interesting, and enjoy hearing what they're all about. i'm have a nice smile, i'm friendly and driven. people tend to remark about how \"together and down to earth\" i am. i interpret that as 'i set realistic goals for myself.' books: i don't have enough free time to read as much as i'd like, but i like reading interesting tidbits about history, other cultures, and various kinds of fiction. movies: across the universe, mirrormask, shaolin soccer, cowboy bebop, lola rennt, big trouble in little china, ice age, aliens, harry potter, underworld, the seven samurai, blade, casablanca, laputa: castle in the sky, hidalgo, the road warrior, mists of avalon, the goonies, master & commander, jason and the argonauts, tron, labyrinth, steamboy, paprika, millennium actress tv: bsg, firefly and veronica mars (my favs keep getting canceled!) music: a wide range that's hard to nail down. pretty much anything besides hip hop and rap. can be listening to something casual and laid back like the dandy warhols and then something like nightwish the next. food: chinese, japanese, german, and italian. seafood, cheeses, wines, and beers are also great! family, friends, computers, music, good food, a fun job meeting an awesome girl i can really connect with, why else would i be on sites like this right?  besides that, probably work. in a cutting edge industry like mine it pays to keep on top of everything that's going on. i go out with friends on thursday nights, so usually by friday i'm just looking to do something relaxing and rest up for doing something fun on saturday! i'm usually a pretty open book, you want to know, you can usually just ask. at the same time, spilling the interesting stories out for free takes away all the fun of actually getting to know someone.  here's a freebie, one nice thing about my job is no one wears a suit. i dislike suits because they're so stiff (figuratively and literally), so if you ever see me in one you know i'm going out of my way to \"dress to impress\". you should message me if you're looking for an activity partner, casual hangout buddy, or a potential date. i can be pretty busy with work and not checking okc mail regularly, so if you are interested, messaging me first is a great way to let me know.  ideally, i'm looking to meet up with people who are around the attending college to recently-graduated college range, since that's pretty much who i identify with.  i live in the east bay and work in san mateo, and so i'm up for meeting people who live or work in/near the east bay, san francisco, or san mateo - it's purely a commute issue.\n",
      "hi, i'm a native californian and love nature and being outside. my friends would describe me as down to earth, spiritual, adventurous, funny and smart. i have many interests and endless curiosity to learn new things about the world. i know myself well and take good care of myself. while i was born and raised in california, i have traveled widely and lived in other places. i always seem to come home and i feel blessed to live here close to family and friends and able to take advantage of all the beautiful locales. some of my favorite places are on the central coast or in the sierra nevada. i'm also a fan of tropical places, especially hawaii. i work to protect the environment and to teach people about why it's important. being environmentally aware is an ingrained habit and my mind thinks about the planet from a systems point of view. i compost, make very little waste, am conscious about chemicals and packaging, eat local, organic, in season food whenever possible (i've really been enjoying the farmer's market bounty). i'd say my biggest downfall when it comes to being environmentally conscious is driving my car :(. i used to beat myself up for it, ever since i stopped doing that, i'm so much happier! i am a yogi, can you be \"good\" at yoga? i have an eye for design, fashion and color. i'm a great friend. i'm learning to be a better negotiator and mediator. staying in my center. preparing a good meal. my sense of style, my sense of humor. i'm a bit of a foodie, and i love all types of food, especially fresh, local organic that is well prepared. i eat mostly vegetarian, but i am an omnivore. i'm part of a book club where we read mostly fiction. the thing i like most about book club is the company, a co-ed crowd from 40 to 70 y.o. and the food, oh and the books and discussion are good too. i read alot of buddhist and spirituality books, most recently i've been reading david richo and john o'donohue. i love all types of music. while i swore i would always be the hip cutting edge music lover when i was young, i haven't kept up that well as the years go by. some of my faves are neil young, alison krauss, ben harper, cake, sublime, jack johnson. i don't watch alot of tv, i do keep up with grey's anatomy, glee and new girl, that's about it for the tele. if i had more than rabbit ears i might watch jon stewart and mad men. movies....i love movies and i liked the irony of american beauty. the descendants was great more recently. the emotion of the situation, the way the main character stepped up to taking care of his family, the scenery...all of those things made for a satisfying movie going experience. water- (to drink or swim or play in), ice cream, my bed (could do without it while camping, but it's good to come home to), friends, family, sunshine. what i want to do with my free time usually tired after a long week. i sometimes get take out and have a mellow evening at home. sometimes i'm heading out of town, sometimes i go out on the town with friends. i'll have to admit it once i know you better. you want to create a partnership that provides a safe place to learn, grow, love and support. you have a sense of adventure and want a partner who can join you on the journey. you want to laugh, play, have fun and enjoy life.\n",
      "i'm fascinated by people. part of this interest is due in part to my intense desire for intimacy (the kind in your head, not your pants). i love to cuddle. i like to study what others do and enjoy. i also enjoy meeting new people and chatting, although i can be a bit shy at times.  i grew up as a fairly shy person but have grown out of it a bit (or at least can act the part sometimes), which is why i can say i enjoy something of a social life. this is my thrill. my roller coaster.  i'm fond of seeing new places, traveling to parts of this country that i've not been to before. my final frontier is another continent, unless space travel becomes affordable.  i'm vegetarian (been so for about 1.5 decades). i'd really love to find other vegan/vegetarian folks. this doesn't make me hostile to non-vegetarians, however.  at this time, i'm probably a 4 or 5 on the kinsey scale. i have many wonderful female friends, but i'd love to have a bit more with someone special. :-) i'm a massage therapist working in various capacities. i really do enjoy connecting with people. this is why i'm here. helping others brings me joy, and with massage, i can help them feel better. i'm also trying to share the joy of touch and cuddling with people i meet.  making people happy is a general goal of mine. i know i can't save the world, but i do feel good when i can bring a little joy to someone. :-)  i live with my bunny. he's black. he's been with me for several years now. as far as humans go, i'm at a point in my life where i want to develop deeper, stronger connections with people who are important to me.  i've finally started playing a tabletop role-playing game! it's so engrossing! also, it's lots of fun. :-)  photography is my other world. i enjoy going out with my camera. a little while back, i began exploring contact improv (dance) again. it reminds me of cuddling in motion. it's fun and challenging (physically and mentally).  i'm loving my friends and finding new faces to meet. i'm pretty good at a lot of things i do. i can knit. drive without crashing my car. i can use a computer (i'm primarily a mac user) and have skills with various tools to make art (or at least things that make me happy).  i'll forever be a dabbler in many skills. some better than others. some i do for work, some just for fun.  i'm really good at monopoly. really. i even do auctions.  i've heard that i'm really good at communicating. if this is true, it's a recent occurrence as i've been making a huge focus on improving it lately.  things i'm really bad at   recalling absolute time between events in the past.  remembering how to work a computer command line. hmm. my soft voice, i believe. if you crack me up, you'll totally notice my giggle. if not that, then maybe my smile. i suppose there are physical things too, like my height (if you're shorter than me) and my body type.  or maybe you don't notice me at all :-) this here is just a list of things current and past.  books i've enjoyed: the bean trees  barbara kingsolver, speak laurie halse anderson, anything about pern/the dragonriders of pern series  anne mccaffrey, stephanie plum mysteries  janet evanovich, ramona quimby and other character books  beverly cleary, a wrinkle in time madeleine l'engle, sword of truth series  terry goodkind, kinsey millhone mysteries  sue grafton  movies i've liked (in no particular order): avatar, superman, pixar films, short circuit/2, flight of the navigator, jurassic park (the first two, the third kinda sucked), the hudsucker proxy, the original star wars trilogy, benny and joon, amlie, scott pilgrim vs. the world various airplane disaster movies, and plenty more  tv shows i've liked: buck rogers (thank you, hulu!), doctor who (i think i love all things whedon), dollhouse, eureka, fringe, heroes, newhart (all of the bob newhart series, really), legend of the seeker, little house on the prairie, lost, the nine (no, the other one that came on after lost before it got cancelled.), under the umbrella tree (good canadian children's programming), monk, stargate: sg-1, stargate: atlantis, star trek (tos, ds9 and voyager) and torchwood (go bbc!).  music i like: classical (beethoven, tchaikovsky, camille saint-sans) | alternative | rock and roll | pop | jazz | soundtracks (john williams)| and because i don't care to break these down by genre: modern stuff (sixpence none the richer, a fine frenzy, the everly brothers, the righteous brothers, the beach boys (i love the song \"kokomo\"), some other currently unknowns that i've discovered through itunes free song of the week). also astrud gilberto is tied to a lot of special memories for me. i think this qualifies as eclectic (minus rap and metal).  food i like: my favorite foods seem to always include cheese (how will i ever be vegan? though i am eating more vegan alternatives. ^_^). i've been exploring restaurants too. genres i enjoy/am familiar with include chinese, indian, italian, mexican and thai.  there's no category for this, but i'm going to list my favorite websites as well: facebook.com, craigslist.org, roughlydrafted.com, xkcd.com, pbfcomics.com, notalwaysright.com, clientsfromhell.net and of course wikipedia.org. something to read cuddles my wonderful and loving friends learning new things my cell phone (gives me something to do at night when i'm in bed (email/reading)) sleep (although apparently, i've been doing without this a lot lately) how i might frame the world around me. how particular lighting would be good for shooting various subjects. yes. photography again.  i also spend a lot of time thinking about what other people think or might be thinking about. how my life's experiences have shaped me and influenced the decisions i've made and how the same occurs to everyone else. i also think about how this world could be a better place if onlyyou know. i think about people i know and my relationships with them. relationship structures are also something that have been garnering a lot of my attention lately.  i think about love and affection. sexuality is something that comes up from time to time too. it's just not a big priority for me, although i do appreciate intimate affection, as is evidenced by my love of receiving massage or touch in general. my level of sexuality is probably closer to the asexual end of the sexual-asexual spectrum, but exactly where it falls, i keep revising.  i also spend time reviewing my day and the relationships i have with my friends and how i can improve them.  i think a lot, i think. at home. maybe reading online or doing some work. maybe catching up on some of my favorite television programming (netflix is addictive). on some nights, i'm out on the town, enjoying life. :-) i do best one-on-one, as group interaction (especially with many people) is still challenging to me. i'm a little pedantic at times.  i've had to struggle with some things in my life. this leaves me with a little baggage (with a few surprises) ***if you haven't significantly completed the essay portion of your profile (especially with things that relate to what i've expressed in my profile), i'm less likely to respond. this is especially the case if you have nothing of note in your message. i don't mean to be harsh, but i want you to know why i didn't respond. :-) with that in mind:***  i sound like someone you'd like to get to know.  you're vegetarian/vegan.  you like bunnies.  you want to make beautiful art with me.  you're a cuddle monster (and know how to respect boundaries).  you're poly.  you have questions for me?\n",

      "i'm a self professed omni-geek. meaning i'm into a lot of very geeky things and things that most don't find geeky. like i think of myself as a sex geek, comic book geek, music geek, kinky geek, book geek, food geek, etc etc etc. i think i've made my point.  music is a big part of my life. i'm either listening to or downloading it daily. i like to get out to a concert or club when possible but i don't have the funds to do it often.  i'm honestly a slacker by \"normal\" standards. i'm also a bit of a geek. i play video games and have for almost 20 years. of late i have been spending just way too much time playing fallout new vegas on my xbox 360. want to distract me?  i play and run role playing games of various sorts, from vampire to d&d. my favorite game is the one i can play the least -- deadlands -- which is sad since i own damn near all the books.  i am a collector. the things i collect include comic books, cd's, playing card decks, books, action and horror movies and figures, and, most importantly, good people. i'm not really looking for more girlfriends, but i am always open to more lovers, and i never turn down finding new friends.  limits are made to be pushed. i like to go to non-vanilla play parties and have been getting more involved in the \"adult film\" industry. recently, i was the guy who kept my clothes on... but it didn't seem to hurt my performance, according to the girls involved. i have meet some really cool people during my visits to the kink dot com armory.  this had lead me to try out a lot of things sexually that you couldn't have paid me to do a few years before. i'm about five times kinkier than i was before was 1. poly and 2. more open minded.  i may have serious quirks, but i'm learning not to take them seriously!!  i'm not that good at selling my self on these sites so bear with me as you read. i'm worth the time.  i am geeky, ever-evolving, and loyal i'm mostly making sure my mom and little brother have things taken care of. that's trickier, now that i don't live with them.  then i find time for my friends, sweeties and litany of hobbies. that's the major stuff. oh yeah, i'm forever on the search for people that i can get alone with, preferably women. my preference is for lady's that look like women with curves in all the right places. and unlike the fashion industry i don't want girls that look like under fed 12 year old boys with coke habits, but i also really enjoy smaller women and the nice variety of the ones in the middle. entertaining friends new and old.  video games, role playing, random media and comic book trivia.  sex (learning new things and using that to please whomever i'm with.) and music (listening to it and being a critic, not making it sadly).  listening and advising.  being a cooking bachelor food, and eating what others have cooked for me. (gamer rule #2: never turn down free food!!)  there is something very sexy about a good meal before good sex and a snack after to build energy for another round. that i always have a ball cap or some kind of hat on. i like trench coats and dusters that, and the trying to get beautiful women to smile or \"arrive\". :^) (a)the anita black vampire hunter series by laurell k. hamilton; authors kim harrison, l.a. banks, kelly armstrong, robert e howard and stephen king; cyberpunk fiction writers like william gibson; and mystery writers like elmore leonard, james elroy, and walter mosley. although i prefer listening to reading -- audio-books rule!! i still collect the physical books, tho.

(c)i listen to many types of music. faves bands are strapping young lad, nile, mudvanye, metallica, megadeth, korn, lee press-on and the nails, n.i.n, slipknot , stone sour, tool , a perfect circle, pusicifer, dragon force and king diamond, lacuna coil, alice in chains, echo & the bunnymen, static x, elton , run-dmc , van halen , rammstein , zz top , peter gabriel , phil collins , they might be giants, big daddy voodoo , cherry poppin' daddies , prince , micheal jackson ,janet jackson , and countless others over countless genres.

(e) tv i try not to miss includes supernatural,burn notice, covert affairs, sons of anarchy, terriers, rescue me, pawn stars, and professional wrestling (yes, i know that it is scripted).  (f) video games i love: silent hill 1 & 2, the grand theft auto series since three ( love san andreas ), l.a noir , alan wake , skyrim, left 4 dead 1 & 2 , mafia 1 & 2 , bully, fallout 1- new vegas, bioshock 1 & 2, saint's row 1 & 2, and the 3rd , deus ex human revolution . the guitar hero series, red dead redemption, ghost busters, the rock band series, the mass effect series, the warriors, dead space, assassins creed 1 & 2 (all three parts), borderlands, condemned, batman: arkham asylum, batman: arkham city , stranglehold, wwe smackdown vs. raw ,2009 2010, 2012 , brutal legend, the darkness 1 & 2, max payne 1 & 2, and the list goes on. let me not start on the n.e.s games. my friends  my xbox 360  music/ comic books  pasta  movies  sex with new and interesting women if i'll meet more nice poly -- or poly-friendly -- women that are geek friendly and like casual sex as much as i do and can talk about any of the things i've listed before, during and after.  that i'm happy having my own place.  funny new ways to sate my curiosity. it's constant.  keeping the people in my life happy, emotionally and otherwise.  trying to stay sane with my bills and the lack of money to pay them. i'm hanging out with my close friends. either eating, gaming (either tabletop or larp), watching movies or talking.  on the rare blue moon clubbing or a good concert. i'm very shy about talking to girls and people in big groups. ... you like to have a good time.  ... you love sex and everything that goes with it. more so doing it and what causal sex means.  ... you like geeky people.  ... you are ready to try anything, once, twice if we like it.  ... you love talking about anything for hours.  ... you are a bi, poly gamer girl who likes music, movies and pasta.  and / or --  ... you can say the contra code without thinking about it or using google.

      "i'm shy and soft spoken, but get along with most people. i'm also family oriented and looking for someone to eventually spend the rest of my life with (kind of sappy).  my life right now has been primarily routine lately (work, eat, sleep), which isn't necessarily a bad thing when i do compliment this with periodic activities with friends and/or family (and once in awhile strictly by my lonesome). i understand there are a lot of things i still haven't done in my life (i.e. i have debated about skydiving), but i am relatively open to try new things, especially when accompanying others. taking long walks, going to the gym, watching movies (mostly rental), singing (not very good though), taking pictures (not a professional), traveling domestically/internationally, hanging out with friends, spending time with family... i love to dance and when the occasion arises at parties i love to participate. who's up for the electric slide? i'm a good friend and people can count on me. friends and family have said i'm humorous. i'm somewhat decent with technological devices, albeit i'm not one to find the need to get the latest and greatest devices either. i've been told i have a nice smile and very polite. i'm not an avid book reader as i use to, but i enjoyed angels and demons, survivor's club, les misrables and the harry potter series. if comics count [though i do not collect anymore] i'm a fan of the archie comics series, which influenced my profile name.  my favorite movies are groundhog day, inception, my fair lady, indiana jones series, toy story series and the lord of rings series.  as to music i guess you can say i like the genres easy listening and soft rock. my favorite musical artist include abba, air supply, carpenters, elton john, linda ronstadt, sarah mclachlan and stylistics (i guess i'm stuck primarily in the 70s or 80s).  i don't really watch tv much with exception of the news. i am relatively open to watch whatever anyone is watching in the room, but i'm beginning to enjoy the big bang theory. a friend said i was like sheldon, but i can assure you i'm not. he has more game than i do.  my favorite types of food are chinese and italian. family, friends, love, a [digital] camera, the internet and lotion. relationships (not in one, but would eventually like to), travel (possible future destinations, but not including the moon), music (i'm constantly playing some type of tune in my head), space and work (pulling hair. argh!!!). i stare up at the sky looking at where i think the stars might be. darn the fog. on a serious note i might be browsing online and/or catching up on my magazines. i am actually finding myself looking at the early morning/night sky more often due to my renewed interest in space. fetishes, quirks, etc. are meant for conversations down the line in a relationship. as to something i can volunteer here... i like to quote lyrics to a song in a conversation or actually try to sing part of a song in relation to a topic. if you had the tolerance to read all the dialogue above and still hold an interest i thank you. now see below for all the remainder fun stuff, which might deter the remainder 99% of women who visit my profile (or attract; i don't know):  message me if you're looking for someone honest, sincere, faithful and actually looking for a relationship. also...  the person i'm looking for should be generally optimistic. i'm not talking about \"ned flanders\" positive, but i prefer to not hear constantly in a conversation about how the world is against her or gripe about her ex-boyfriend. despite the general consensus i'm not a professional therapist. i'm willing to listen to people (particularly friends) and provide feedback, but this just kills the mood.  i like dancing. unless you have a walking disability i would like to dance with you eventually. i'm not the most graceful dancer on the floor, but i enjoy this social interaction. i took a ballroom dancing class ages ago and i'm feeling this has gone to waste. in fact i might have to reference back to my paper material to refresh my memory (or make a futile attempt at taking lessons with youtube clips). if you don't know how to dance we can learn together.\n",

      "born in louisiana, raised in texas. i lived in dallas, tx for most of my life and went to college there. love the city for what it is, but it was very important for me and my life to live in a different city/state. so, after i graduated college i immediately started searching for a new job in a new city and ended up landing out here in san francisco.  in oct '11 i moved out to this city and i've loved every second of it. being able to walk everywhere, the energy, the amount of life in a small area and also being able to get away from all of that whenever i want to.  i love being outside around others, meeting new people and doing things that i love (photography, design, biking) and just enjoying the weather! i also enjoy being inside and enjoying a movie. what i'm doing depends on what i've done the past few days usually. i do my best to live a balanced life.  finally, random adventures are the best. currently i'm a presentation designer and always looking for ways to better myself and enjoying life as much as possible. i take a lot of photographs, study and practice design, spend time with my friends and speak with my family on the phone every chance i get.  i also work evenings->nights, so i get to enjoy the daylight hours whenever i want :).  the most important thing to me is to make those around me feel special and encourage them be better/pursue their passion. to leave the world a bit better.  living the dream :) photography. design. bowling. caring for others. staying relaxed. enjoying the moment. learning from my mistakes. finding the best in a situation or others. i would guess my relaxed, accepting demeanor. books: ender's game, halo: the fall of reach, crush it, the things i've learned in my life so far, the strength to love.  currently reading: the hunger games  movies: shrek, lord of the rings, amlie, anything pixar and studio ghibli.  shows: true blood, the walking dead, glee, how i met your mother, big bang theory.  music: i like pretty much everything, just depends on the mood im in... except for most country.  food: sushi is my favorite <3_<3 - i've fallen out of love for beef, though i still like it on occasion. i definitely miss texas bbq and texmex with a passion. bicycle camera friends family compassion women (our species would die!) i think about our world a lot. thankful for where i am in life and what is the next step. current events. politics. things that matter. where we are going. i don't have a typical friday night routine, just depends on how i'm feeling that day and what my friends are up to. spend 5 minutes with me and you'll know what to expect out of me. i'll also answer pretty much any question as long as it's asked right!  also... i'm a texas rangers fan. if you want to talk about serious subjects such as politics, religion, the current events, etc.  if you can claim to be \"from the internet\".  enjoy photography, design, random adventures, biking, etc ^^.\n",
      "i've lived very different lives through my years. it began in guangzhou china, post communist take over of the family assets, and in a single house with my late grandfather's 2 other wives. to the us starting over living as an immigrant in a ghetto, roving around as a pack, getting into fights and struggling in school. to living in the suburbs, being a model student. to a lost undergraduate, trying to find my direction. to a determined graduate student, living a semi-married life. to a tech start-up cofounder, funded and moved to san francisco, working long hours and partying all weekend. a few start-ups and years later, i find myself here. more laid back, my crowd all growing up.  i believe in strength of the self, as long as we have our life, sanity and health, we can always rebuild. when i was younger i thought i could do it all by myself. now i realize the importance of someone having your back.  being on here has been interesting. it opens up opportunities in meeting people i would not have otherwise. i don't have high expectations here but you never know :) finding the right balance in life. at least half my attention is on my career. i'm lucky my childhood hobby turned into what people call a job. it doesn't feel like a job when it is what i would be doing in my free time anyway. at the same time i'm looking at my vacation time spreadsheet, plotting and watching for the next lull at work to take off out of the country.  i like to free form travel. tours are a bit too restrictive for my taste. i love to have a local tour guide though. that immediately opens up access to years of experience on a location.  there is always more things i want to do than i have time for. at the moment i'm working on: -working at a tech start-up -experimenting with food -cycling -break dance -planning the next trip when i find an activity i like, i spend considerable time and effort towards mastery.  finding things to do when i should be sleeping. wikipedia is my bane. applying linear regression to everyday life. i like tracking data on spreadsheets. following the musical beat with my feet. i'm working on getting the arms involved too. convincing myself to continue on after setting a goal (ex: biking 160 miles). cooking things i like to eat. i like to start off as the laid back guy quietly observing the surroundings. random sampling: the great gatsby,blindsight,the eight,the great train robbery zombieland,any ,inception,matrix(first),up seinfeld,archer,daily show tiramisu,mapo tofu,o-toro, just a dream,ne-yo,classical,, the lazy song, ooh hoo, ooh hoo, hoo ooh ooh, nothing at all. a connection to the internet asian super markets a sushi restaurant that has o-toro eggs music sleep who i am, what i'm willing to be, where i am heading and who i should be taking on this trip. the difference between calculation and choice. probabilities and collapsing wave functions. bboying, dining out, hanging out with friends, cooking up something, reading, catching up on sleep. when there's nothing else on, there is a random song playing in my head in repeat. so if you see me dancing weirdly with no music, now you know why. \"but could youth last and love still breed had joys no date nor age no need...\"\n",
      "be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind. -dr. seuss  i'm in the strange (but hardly unique) position of both knowing exactly what i want and being completely clueless about it. a career in science, engineering, or something more entrepreneurial (if i ever have the balls to pursue it) has always seemed inevitable but, given that i'm not really one for school, the way to get there is hardly obvious.  in high school i was a research intern at a ucsf affiliated computational neuroscience lab running my own psychoacoustics experiment, the captain of my school's first robotics team, a surprisingly successful handyman, tutor, and computer repair person, and a mediocre student at best (except for one awful semester when i decided i cared about college). at the end of my junior year i had to drop out of school to support my family and went to work full time, starting by expanding the part time stuff i had going in high school, and then slowly turning that into a software consulting business. a year grinding at that for about 100 hours a week gave me a healthy hatred of working for mbas who think they will change the world and become rich, fixing washing machines, and removing the viruses people got looking at czech porn websites using ie 6 (specifically czech. you would be surprised by how many of them are fucking czech...).  my main interests are computers/technology/programming, mma (i mainly train in brazilian jiu jitsu and judo right now - getting hit in the head a lot makes programming really hard), music (guitar, bass, and singing), and games (of the video, tabletop, board, and pen and paper varieties).  i want to make a career at the intersection of information science, artificial intelligence, and user experience design... or something like that...  multiple teachers and professors have called me an old man. i'm a part time student at the local community college majoring in computer science, and a software, product, and hardware consultant for start ups and small companies.  in my spare time i'm working on a software project to help people manage the information that they're responsible for that should be on the android market soon. by my standards, nothing. by most people's, programming and fixing things, probably.  i had the best peanut butter and chocolate chip cookie recipe ever (took me 14 batches to work out), but wasn't thinking and erased it off of one of my whiteboards during a business call before copying it down. i've never had a peanut butter and chocolate chip cookie that good since. have you ever heard the term social lubricant? good, i'm glad we're on the same page. i'm really more of a social abrasive.  i'm also pretty loud. books: - anything by feynman - a song of ice and fire (before it was cool, i swear) - a brave new world - the road - a clockwork orange - 1984 - ender's game - slaughter house five  movies: i've never really been that into them but the rear window was pretty good, i guess.  tv: - mma (mostly ufc, strikeforce, and bellator) - community - modern family - game of thrones  music: just about everything. i like to play blues, jazz, and thrash metal, though.  video games: - lol - starcraft 1, 2, and bw - morrowind - kotor - pokemon (who the fuck doesn't like pokemon?!) - mass effect  food: i'll try anything once, and only dislike a couple things. thai, japanese, and italian are my favorite, though.  favorite quote from this site: \"favorite sign from occupy berkeley: birgeneau: law students protesting not not non-violence!\" my family learning opportunities friends music food a comfortable toilet well you can't win with this one, but i guess i should try.  i used to spend a lot of time thinking about the meaning of life, social equality, and all of that shit, but a couple years ago i realized that worrying about big things just makes me sad, so i said fuck it and think about happy things now.  i spend most of my time thinking about projects i'm working on for work, school, or fun - i've gotten pretty good at finding ways to only do interesting things. i like to roll ideas around in my head until they're smooth like river rocks before throwing them at things. just pretend the metaphor worked.  i also spend a lot of time thinking about bjj, it's a lot like that chess game from the first harry potter book, but being a pasty nerd is a disadvantage. working... college is really fucking expensive...  sometimes i have friends over, though. you're still reading, so fuck it.  1) midnight to five am are my most active hours, and at least one of them is usually spent pacing around my apartment in boxers animatedly talking to myself.  2) i... i don't know a lisp... *hangs head in shame* you identify with the waka flocka flame song \"hard in the paint\". http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkkc9ck8hz0  i have yet to meet someone who does, but think i would either find it fascinating or frightening.\n",
      "like a job interview, i suck at this sort of thing. my parents are mid-westerners, so they raised me to not be boastful of myself. this question has lead to a couple weeks of introspective thought, so i'm pretty confident of the accuracy of my self-image. i'm one of those cool nerds, and down right dorky when i'm really excited about something. i'm an intellectual, not an academic. that doesn't mean i didn't succeed in school, as i was an excellent student. i just prefer learning for the sake of itself over jumping through hoops for degree requirements. i value knowledge and plan earning an advanced degree. while having a core group of friends i consider family, i am also a social butterfly. i love experiencing new places and meeting new people. i have a dozen or so friends, but thousands of acquaintances. i am lazy and also extremely active. i'm kind of like a siberian husky that lays around all day, but then goes for a three-hour run. i cook my own food, and eat a balanced diet. i don't workout as much as i should, but genetics has seemed to have mostly taken care of things for me. i am a single-father, dealing with the reality of my situation the best i can. i love my son, and make it a priority to be a the best father i can be. i am a lot of fun, and want someone to tell jokes to, cook dinner with, join on a road trip, or watch a movie with at home. i just want to spend time with an equal, and it doesn't have to be more than that. i'm not ruling out marriage, but it would really take someone special to make that commitment. they would also be making a commitment to my son as well, so if i get married, it would be for keeps. i spend a lot of time entertaining myself, because a lot in this world bores me. i'm trying to turn that into a career through blogging, but it will probably just end up as a hobby. i have a young son that i love dearly, which stopped me from continuing my education for a neuroscience phd. father's need to earn, so i'm providing for my son the best i can. i highly value education, but i need to focus on a career now. i've found my way into a cushy marketing position, and i will probably stay here until i have time for grad school. ro sham bo i'm polite and kind. i go out of my way to be sure others are comfortable around me. i'm also a lot of fun, and usually find the fastest way to make you laugh. sports: open water swimming, biking, mountain biking, running, skiing, snowboarding, soccer  music: funk, electro music, breaks, drum and bass, jazz fusion, kraftwerk, deep house, ethno house, early punk, new wave  books: atlas shrugged, the good book: a humanist bible, god is not one: the eight rival religions that run the world, stuff white people like, our man in havana, hamlet, count of monte cristo, a language older than words  movies: fantastic mr. fox, district 9, real genius, the yes men fix the world, stranger than fiction, transformers: the movie (1986), gigantic, the life aquatic, the royal tenenbaums, balls out: gary the tennis coach, smart people, the sea wolves, the hangover, whatever works, silverado, king of hearts, kelly's heroes, the great escape, santa clause conquers the martians, dr. strangelove  tv: the league, game of thrones, deadwood, archer, flight of the conchords, the colbert report, the daily show, important things with demetri martin, curb your enthusiasm, south park, the life and times of tim, parks and recreation, the office, top gear, breaking bad, lost, caprica, magnum, p.i., battlestar galactica, spartacus, men of a certain age, psych, old jews telling jokes, stargate universe, stargate atlantis, stargate camera - i'm a shutterbug. i like taking photos of things i find funny, interesting, or bizarre.  phone - not for talking, i need the internet at all times.  laptop - i write a lot, and the phone doesn't always cut it.  car - i hate being on someone else's schedule, so i usually have my own car with me. this allows me to come and go as i please.  vibram five fingers shoes - i run, and those funny shoes you see people wearing really help prevent foot injury. i wear them anytime i'll be on my feet a lot.  friends -

      "hey!  here are 6 random tidbits about me:  1. i have a lot of inside jokes that i'm the only person inside of. but i find myself making reference to them in conversations as if everyone knows what i'm talking about.  2. when i was in 5th grade my elementary school had a \"dress as your favorite black hero/shero day.\" i reminded my parents everyday for three weeks that i needed a costume, but of course they forgot to get one. but instead of doing the respectable thing and letting me stay home for the day, they pulled out an old dashiki from my father's closet and made me go as, and i quote, \"general colin powell....at home.\"  3. in the past 6 years i've been to about 30 countries (and i worked in china and hong kong for a couple years). but i scaled back when i started law school, which is probably a good thing: after a while every place looks the same.  4. on every job i've had i've reached a day (or a month) when i've seriously considered calling in a bomb threat so that i wouldn't have to come into the office that day.  5. when i was young i would try to give my allowance to the poor. only, i didn't know who was poor. so i would walk up and down the street stopping people, \"excuse me, are you poor?\" and, of course, i got cursed out hundreds of times. \"fuck you!\" \"hell no!\" \"do i look like i'm poor?!\" no good deed goes unpunished.  6. politically, i'm very liberal (perhaps even radical) but personally i'm pretty conservative. for example, i think if people want to be in open relationships or experiment with drugs, they should be free to do so but i don't want either for myself. i like to think that i add a touch of blandness to a world full of flavor. i was born and raised in chicago. went to undergrad and law school on the east coast. worked in asia for a few years. now i'm just arriving in the bay area (in late june 2012) to start a phd program. i've always wanted to make my way out here and i'm happy that i finally did. now i don't have to spend half the year finding ways to avoid going outside into the snow. 1. being dependable (if i say i'm going to do something, i will. and i like people who are similar.) 2. communicating 3. bargain shopping (i hope to one day become an extreme couponer) 4. procrastinating 5. i really think i have a gift for figuring people out. i sometimes come off as aloof, but i'm really not. i just have a stern resting face. i tried to appear friendlier by walking through the streets smiling all the time. but that made me look stupid. my favorite restaurant is the popeyes chicken in manhattan on 14th st. between 5th and 6th.  my current favorite album is amy winehouse's lioness. but i recently found out that anita baker is still alive so i'm hoping that she'll drop another album soon.  i don't get into tv that much but i often listen to old episodes of \"the wendy williams experience\" (the radio show) on youtube. 1. humor 2. smart ones desserts 3. body pump 4. good conversations 5. a microwave (i don't know how to cook so if it can't be made in the microwave, it's not for me). 6. fruit (particularly, grapes, mangoes, kiwis and pineapples) on one hand: race, politics and class issues.  on the other: spirituality (being grateful for small things, living in the present, all that good stuff).  and on the third hand (just go with it for a second): analyzing people and figuring out how to pay less for my favorite things. half the time: laughing with friends somewhere.  the other half: sitting in my pajamas, watching something on hulu and promising myself that tomorrow night will be different. sometimes i compare my life's trajectory to mariah carey's and it always makes me feel inadequate.  (i.e. at 27 i graduated from law school single. but by the time mariah was 27 she was an international superstar, sold a hundred million albums, married, divorced, and was dating a professional baseball player.) 1. you keep your shirt on when you go to gay clubs. 2. you're fun to spend time with (dry humor is a plus). 3. you fancy yourself as being at least somewhat socially conscious. 4. you're reliable and stable (mentally and otherwise).\n",
      "i'm from seattle originally, but have been in san francisco off and on for school since 2007. as of a year and a half ago, i'm here indefinitely and i love it.  i'm a filmmaker

burritos, and intense political/religious debates with family members. essentially making as many movies as i can with my canon 7d in the hopes of developing my film and video career into something that can pay the bills. recently, my buddies and i have gotten a few music videos under our belts, but a feature film is coming fast on the horizon, with filming set for february '13. scary.  other than that, i go to school and work part time at apple downtown as a personal trainer and technician. i'm good at drawing and sketching. usually with grayscale markers, although i've started

      "i want to take off my coat, i want to take off my hat, i want to take off my shoes, i want to take off my pants, i want to take off my underwear! i want candy! officially? research? i'm getting a lot better at checking that my fly is done up before teaching my class. i think people usually think i'm a boy. that's okay.  my friend's grandmother is apparently an exception: \"she's so cute, she's got a little girl's voice, a betty boop voice. i thought she was fifteen at first.\" listen: i'm a giant pig. sometimes when people say, \"where do you put it all?\" i think, \"in my mouth.\" is everyone else doing it wrong?  some people don't like it when you refer to magazines as \"books\" but i really like the books that appear in my mailbox each week. current favourite titles include, \"july 25, 2011\" and \"august 1, 2011.\" (fine, there are some others too.)  if \"fitzcarraldo\" were the only movie ever made, that might be okay. lately i've been watching movies only on airplanes. i didn't much care for \"inception,\" but i was so happy that i understood my friend when he exclaimed, \"whoa! that's like the inception of sandwiches!\" it really was!  the tv lives in the closet, but the last time i was sick in bed i watched both seasons of lars von trier's \"the kingdom.\" it was pretty great and i'll watch it again next time i'm sick. (a decent immune system keeps this from happening too often.)  i hate admitting it but, er, i can be dumb and lazy when it comes to music. hey before you get all eye-rolly...it's not so bad! some kind of radio is almost always on and alternating between ckut's wefunk and wqxr's q2 keeps me in pretty good shape.  cat videos.  okay is it snacktime yet? pants my cat. he's little and black and his name is batman. i talk about him a lot too, which people must find pretty tedious if they don't think about him as much as i do, which they don't. i also spend a good amount of time thinking about boys and math and bikes and, lately, who killed laura palmer, but mostly it's just my cat. it's a good thing he's cute because that guy is a total idiot. you gonna eat that? i'm little but i think i'm big.  and. i've recently started a collaboration with one of my best friends. it makes me happy because he and i have complementary strengths and because it means we talk a lot more now. we're trying to do something kindof difficult. we think we have a shot if we work really hard. if it works, it'll be super cool. if it doesn't, i think i'll be pretty disappointed but i'll pretend not to be (like, when a boy asks the girl/boy of his dreams out by saying, \"do you want to go out? if not, you know, whatever. i don't care.\"). so the private thing that i'm admitting is that i really really really want it to work. oh man, my fingers are so crossed. [update: we did it! my friend's wife is happy to have him back; she'd started calling me his \"work wife.\"] i just wanna ride bikes.  and i hope this doesn't sound rude, but i actually thought about what age limits to indicate in the box above. i'm probably more likely to be interested in someone i consider too young for me than in someone i consider too old. (i do have a bit of a reputation but i insist it's unwarranted!) anyway i've already factored that in. while i'm sure as i push toward my mid-thirties and receive fewer and fewer messages on this site, i'll be more than happy to hear from the older dudes but for now i'm still squarely in the early part of this decade. so message me: right now if you're 28! and a few years from now if you're 62.

      "i'm a single chinese male living in san francisco. originally from nyc. i typically commute to the south bay twice a week for work. i love to try new things: food, music, art, sports, activities. i try to run outside and work out regularly at the gym.  my friends claim i'm a good listener and understanding with a good heart. see if they're right or not.  i'm looking for a sweet lady, kind and gentle. spiritual too (yes i believe there is something beyond living in this world). someone who's self-confident, who likes who she is, and enjoys deep conversations on any topic. i enjoy hanging out with my friends at karaoke, dinner, and dessert places. i try to have one overseas trip each year. last year was london and paris. this year was bali. maybe next year is australia? i've been trying to learn some chinese mandarin and tried to learn the guitar. listening. a little hard to believe for a guy... although i have my own opinion (and be opinionated), i'm good at understanding the other point of view. if you have enough facts, i could even change my opinion.  my friends say i have good manners. i guess you'll have to find out in person :)  i do read enough on sports so i'm pretty current on that subject. yeah, a guy's thing.  lastly i can read while running on a treadmill if there's enough light. probably my most impressive physical skill. lol  what i'm not good at: fashion: i just draw a blank on color coordination or the latest styles. small talk: i'm not big into it. it bores me somewhat easily. i would rather ask you provocative and funny questions. i'm not good at being charming (e.g. \"wow, your outfit matches your handbag\", \"your earrings look so cute on you\"). also not much of a smooth talker. my friendliness. i enjoy introducing visitors to my friends at a function.  i carry one of those coin pouch holders with my house keys. what can i say... i like giving exact change when i buy stuff with cash. my favorite quotes:  do to others as you would have them do to you. [luke 6:31]  hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all wrongs. [proverbs 10:12]  if you think about it, your favorite memories, the most important moments in your life, were you alone? life's better with company, everyone needs a co-pilot. - from the movie \"up in the air\"  \"you don't realize what you have until it's gone. so realize the love you have before it's gone. it may be too late to get it back.\" [unknown author]  if a friend is someone who inspires, who challenges, who sends you in search of some truer sense of yourself, [nathaniel] is indeed a friend. - \"the soloist\" by steve lopez  music is an anchor, a connection to great artists, to history [and to himself]... the notes [of \"rhapsody for cello\" by ernest bloch\"] sit on the staff as they did ninety years ago. the work of beethoven has endured through parts of three centuries and will last beyond our time. music is a meditation, a reverie, a respite from madness. it is [nathaniel's] way to be alone without fear - \"the soloist\" by steve lopez  love means never having to say you're sorry - quote from the novel and 1970 film love story starring ali macgraw and ryan o'neal.  the ability of wall street traders to see themselves in their success and their management in their failure would later be echoed, when their firms, insisted on being rescued by the government in bad times. success was individual achievement; failure was a social problem - \"the big short\" by michael lewis instead of the usual suspects (cell phone, computer, wallet)...  1) oatmeal and almonds- nice handy items when i'm hungry. 2) electric water boiler/warmer - hot water instantly for tea and coffee! 3) my fingerprint - so i can get into 24 hour fitness gym 4) lip balm - when you start using it, it's hard to get used to used to chapped lips when you forget to use it. 5) electric rice cooker - i'm chinese. how can i live without rice for a few days? 6) friends and family - enough said 7) wikipedia - knowledge is power? maybe but i do like quick answers when i have a question or topic in my head. where does the melogold grapefruit come from? what's the significance of osaka castle? and explain in more detail the plot of inception after watching it the first time. i should spend more time thinking about how to find miss right :) hanging out with my friends at karaoke, dinner, and dessert places. once in a while at a club or lounge for a happy hour. i'm a reserved guy, especially when i first meet a person. i have to build some trust to reveal my true feelings. i guess it's not ideal on a first date where people want an awesome first impression. i promise that you won't get that from me. hahaha you think i could be a right fit for you. people say they want to find someone they can talk to all the time. but i was thinking... aren't most successful relationships the ones where you just enjoy each other's company without saying a single word? just a thought :)  i am serious about a long-term relationship. if you are in the stage of your life where you're looking to meet new people, i can try to help you but please be upfront about it. i like to make new friends, but it's not my top priority here.\n",

      "i have been called by more than one individual an incredibly fun, reliable, and loyal friend. some okc women bounce the guys they're interviewing off me for that \"from mars\" viewpoint. we're all here with high hopes and hopefully rooting for each other. so i'm sincere in my search not just for \"the one,\" but also new friends.  and, as friends, we hit the wine country, cheese trips - i have a map! - and hike the california trails in this perfect corner of the world.  i am particularly happy outdoors, whether it's a hike on the dipsea trail or from the mission to the marina. i also enjoy good food and wine (not a snob but somewhat knowledgeable), sports, playing pool, and art and design. i do think i'm something of a hybrid between blue and white collar, regarding a profession that is the latter but abilties related to the former.  chivalry is not dead, manners are second nature to me. i also think one shouldn't point out that one opens doors, pulls out chairs, etc., but i have read too many \"what happened to manners?\" so i feel obliged.  i consider myself as having a good balance between a respectable public persona and a private edge. am hoping to meet someone similar in that way, who is as optimistic and enjoys life as much as i do, and has a great sense of humor. i take humor very seriously. professionally, i help undergrad and grad students get that degree with as little debt as possible, assist them in career choices, resumes, cover letters, and killing an interview. probably a gauge of my success is that many alum are now in their 20's and 30's, still in touch, and running their latest job prospect by me to assist them.

      "lost at the man mall  made in italy and exported to america, i have been straddling two identities all my life. for years i pulled the lever between man-made panels and under fluorescent lights, like a rat in a maze. i could hear the clacking of keyboards and the ringing of phones, people breathing and coughing and farting behind the partition, but i hardly saw anyone, and often had the feeling that if i died on the job no one would notice --- the janitor would find me years later, a pile of ash and bones under the desk, and quietly sweep me up in her dustpan.  then in a very glengarry glen ross twist of fate, i escaped the feng-shui hell of the cube thanks to a layoff, in which the agents of the diseased american corporate machine greeted me with judas air kisses and sorority hugs before escorting me out of the building and into the great wide open of the unknown that is my life now, more 99 percent than i could have ever imagined back in the days when i sang the praises of ceramic induction kitchen ranges, tahoe retreats, and home espresso machines  the important things in life.  now that i am back to work, in the gentler world of higher education, i can look back at those nine months of searching, self-doubt, and occasional despair as an important addition to my long list of humbling experiences ... and one that shares with online dating more than that humorous and horrifying similarity.  i am not a fan of uniforms, whether pierced or rolexed on the body, and while i may still pound my fist on the table in defense of my convictions, i appreciate the value of compromise in achieving some modicum of peace, love, and understanding. status symbols don't impress me as a measure of success, which to me is predicated on the way we are remembered. as privileged as i am to enjoy the elective bohemie of my zip code, i am proud of my working class roots.  the bookshelf is my totem. give me the exiles, the epileptics, the suicides  always good company. ink on paper provides a sense of safety and comfort unlike anything else, except perhaps reading in bed, and not reading alone. i still listen to nirvana. occasionally get the itch for the mosh pit. i am obsessed with edward burtynsky's shipbreaking photographs. like with the 38l, chasing it as it disappears into the distance... suspension of disbelief men my sweater, women my italian boots, cats my halo jaron lanier says online designs like this list, where your life is represented by a silly, phony set of database entries, reduce us as people.  i am very fond of the graduate and the duel between mad madam mim and merlin in the sword in the stone looms in my consciousness  matisse over picasso  camus over sartre  jack white and frank black  stuff i have eaten includes possums and squirrels 1 moral compass, 5 senses what really happened  and  not to be here/not to be anywhere/and soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true. mourning the loss of my enthusiasm i poop... but only sometimes!

      "a little bit about me: i am not a materialistic person. i like nature/animals very much, particularly horses, dogs and wolves. i absolutely love 'food', and enjoy restaurants very much.  i have been into martial arts since i was 12, and still love it, but only train for health purposes, and not professional like i used to.  i am an easy going guy, drama free, supportive, and non-judgmental.  i am very well educated, am worldly, cultural aware.  i enjoy putting on cowboy jeans, and go into the wilderness. when needed, i can equally put on something very sharp, add a tie to it, and enjoy the city settings, such as opera, theater, etc. so in that sense i am flexible.  well, that's for now. i actually prefer to meet in person and talk rather than giving too much further written description about myself.  i am trying to fulfill my dreams, both big and small dreams. i strive towards happiness as much as i can. i work in the field of science. being calm, analytical conversation, having fun in various ways, spoiling horses and dogs. smile, hair when it's long. i have had a lot of compliments about eyes. i like the film industry. favorite actors are: al pacino, robert de niro, morgan freeman, edward norton, denzel washington.  i love food: persian, greek, italian, american, fusion........ 1.family, true friends, laughter 2.faith, love, fun 3.dogs, horses, nature 4.shower, bath, soap 5.music, movie, skype 6.coffee, tea, good food  six things right? love, fun, happiness  aaahahaha - can't tell you what else i think about. varies: out meeting neighborhood friends, visiting family, chilling at home, eating out, wine..... bwahahahahahaha you would be interested to meet for a drink, and see where things go.\n",
      "i play blackjack and texas no limit tournament poker. i like rare and diverse food: the kind you get in cheap ethnic enclaves and underground supper clubs. i've traveled a bit, to places like guatemala and thailand. i climbed mount fuji, lived in india for 6 months and was most recently in london for a year. i am a possibilian. i read a lot. i studied math at ucla and business at uchicago. i am simultaneously laid back and responsible. someone told me that my original \"living it\" was too common.  so how about this: when i was 19 and doing a degree in math, and sitting in classes learning about a lot of things that would never be of much use to me, during this critical period where you're developing your life's philosophy i came up with a math metaphor.  this is what it is: that it's not the function graph (the x-y graph) that matters. it's the derivative graph that matters, the graph of the rate of change.  because people don't notice states. we're like animals, noticing only the movement on the outskirts of our field of vision. we notice differences, especially change. when something amazing like winning the lottery or something terrible like becoming a paraplegic happens, our levels of happiness change for awhile and then revert back to where we used to be.  it's the experience of living, all the phenomena that we experience in our own subjectively objective ways  our time  this is all there is, at least in this life. so i focus on the doing, not the checkmark. pattern recognition. movement, probably in their peripheral vision. favorite books are impossible. ones i've liked: the unbearable lightness of being, the black swan, the rational optimist, sum: 40 tales of the afterlife, the status syndrome, free culture.  i like almost every category of food. regulars include pho, burritos, soup dumplings, whole crab, sushi. latest obsession are different configurations of softly scrambled eggs. i score low on finicky.  tv shows i've liked: band of brothers, the wire, x-files, the simpsons, how i met your mother, the west wing. good people good food regular sleep frequent travel relative freedom and the interweb the nature of time, the value of trust, the interestingness of fractals, the quality of empathy, the prevalence of uncertainty, the definition of art, and how important people are to the richness and texture of my life. also, business strategy. either out drinking with friends or home listening to episodes of radiolab online while i whittle away at my inbox. without being too morbid, i think about death quite a bit to remind myself that this living business is important. you are very laid back, very responsible, and very smart. or just fun.  addendum, since everyone thinks they're all of the above: if you'll eat basically anything. if you never get upset at friends or roommates. if you never count up the balance of accounts in a relationship. if you never miss a bill payment. if you're super anti-lying. if you're often designated driver. if you never borrow money. if you like to read. if you're intuitive on the mbti. if your friends call you smart. if you're up for any adventure. if you have joy in living. if you're silly sometimes.\n",

life doesn't favor those who don't try random shtuff.  **addendum to the addendum: i'm also now training as a voice actor. hopefully that goes somewhere. cooking. i used to be a chef. no kidding. no, i won't make you something. ... unless you're really really good.  i worked in a japanese restaurant and a catering company, but my passions lie in and around whatever is most fresh. i love to frequent farmers' markets and find new and interesting things to make delicious. and i kick ass on a grill, and i'm not talking about just hamburgers. go grill some asparagus or eggplant. dust some peaches in clove and brown sugar, and sear some goodness into them. mmm. maybe i should be doing that instead of writing this. discrepancies.  whatever. i do what i like ;)  i have long and short hair at the same time, i speak my mind to a fault, and i never lie. liars suck. so if you've put on weight, and ask me if you look fat, i'm the kind that would probably say yes. sorry. i'm not mean though, so if you happen to get the pleasure of my acquaintance, and i say something off putting, i apologize in advance...  i've been described as having the tact of a flying mallet. but at least you know i'll never lie to you. ;) princess bride, princess bride, whatever i feel, and any damn thing i can consume.  these categories are so compartmentalized that i don't feel that they can do anyone much justice. if someone wants me to read something, i'll give it a shot. i spent an entire summer watching every movie made in 2004, including some foreign films. i didn't make it, but i liked trying. and i already talked about food up above somewhere. the only thing i'm against, foodwise, is fast food. i eat it rarely. the big problem is that 90% of the time, if i go out to eat, i can't find things on the menu that i can't make better, myself. not bragging, just a fact. if you want to learn to cook, ask. i love to teach. the world needs more people who can really cook and enjoy to do it. since everyone has to eat, eat well. look, more important are 6 things i can never do with.  1 - dishonesty. hate hate hate it.  2 - cats. cats make me choke to death. antihistamines dont help.  3 - dependencies  4 - whiners. if something bugs you, fix it. don't bitch.  5 - closed mindedness.  6 - ok, i'm getting stuck here. maybe i only have five things. hehe. funny junk to teach the kids.  my personal favorite these days is pirate day in phonics. we go looking around for words with \"arrrr\" in them. like carrrrr or farrrrr or marrrrket.  20 six year olds closing one eye, making their fingers into little hooks, and yelling arrrr cracks me up. which basically summarizes my feeling about teaching. sometimes i can't believe they paid me for that. lol. typical? what is this word, typical? how about: ice blocking, geocaching, scavenger hunts, cooking something fun, freestyle walking, or passing out from lack of sleep over the week?  i'm pretty much down for anything, anytime, anywhere. i moved to europe for six months at the drop of a hat, recently forged some spearheads with a buddy of mine, and spend most of my waking life in the dark, if possible. carpe noctem!!! but i'm not against hanging around in bars, bowling, or just playing some hearts. for me, it's the people i'm with, rather than the things that i'm doing, that make the situation fun. hell, i spent all night shoving my friends down a hill on a pallet with ice blocks shoved under it, cause it sounded hilarious. erm, i'm super open. what do you want to know?

      "i laugh a lot, and share a lot of laughter due to slightly hidden, slightly bizarre moments that can be laughed at or viewed as some source of justification of anger. throughout the day i would rather talk about out the funny little aloof events of the day out in the open, and laugh the ignorance and frustrations away, rather than sitting in fear of bringing them up. i am quite fortunate to have ended up in a position where i get to learn a lot about honest human behavior, by kids much less bound to social norms and traditions than us silly adults, essentially every day. philosophers seem to like the term 'human nature' to describe meaningful social behavior, but they can go work themselves over behind a desk without speaking to someone else or looking out a window, as far as i am concerned. most of my work life is based around after school enrichment programs for kids at elementary schools. i get to instruct the kids on how to make basic robotic kits, things that fly (for a short period of time), and other fun projects tied to engineering. for the other time spent at my job i look after kids and help them build basically whatever they feasibly command of me with legos (motorized cars seem to be their favorite). i spend most of my free time with friends exercising or meeting up with larger groups in the evening. i like writing when i get plagued with lyrical thoughts and am not socially obligated to be somewhere. i've been told i work well with kids. i really do care about the kids i work with on a regular basis growing a deepening appreciation for respect, yet as soon as they are gone, i am aware i may have tried very hard for no significant effect if i had a positive effect on a kid in the first place. kids do get this in a way that i think many adults overlook due to disobedience, but i find it far more disrespectful when an adult judges a child for lacking traditional manners that have yet to be given a communicable purpose. it makes me pretty sad at times to see how little attention some of parents pay to these kids for how much they tool around on their iphones and similar gadgets.  on a completely different, but perhaps more pertinent note, young women tell me that i snuggle well. i dunno this is silllllay but i get a lot of random compliments on my patch made flat shoes from goodwill. this would go on waaay too long if i filled this out to my heart's content. i think we might like talking about this more in person, i enjoy many tastes, and dislike very few. i am curious as to why the number six was picked. how about three? how about ten? why not just \"i could never do without\"? is this more so referring to \"up to six things\"? i guess that would not flow so well. however, i think that the above heading was not a well thought out heading, that the average user is subject to without much reason, if any. i think a lot of how i can improve in simple ways day by day. in terms of practice, i find judgments passed from myself or others to be so interesting. what goes around comes around in this respect, i see it and i believe it. i find non-judgment of a person's judgment to be quite comforting. confused yet? the cycles of ouch and the perseverance of love seem to me to be what stick around at the end of the day. usually over at a friend's place with a few others laughing a lot, many times the more the merrier though. finding a place to dance with people is a real treat for me i might add. the above heading is why i didn't want to use the internet to meet people. message me over whatever, whenever.\n",

      "like so many others out there i am a multidimensional person which makes it difficult to give a full representation of myself in such a tiny box. and who is to say that what i chose to put here about myself is what another would use to describe me.  here's what i chose:  i am an observer. i love to watch people to see how they interact and try to learn what they are telling you about themselves without ever using words.  physical fitness is important to me. i usually get to the gym 3 times a week. there i'll lift, swim, and/or pick some other piece of cardio equipment to use. i also regularly play beach/grass volleyball and mountain bike. hiking is something that i don't do often enough, but then i really want company for that and company seems difficult to come by. i want to learn to surf. i think i'll try to get that started soon.  i enjoy beer and wine. most often just because it is tasty and i feel like having a little, but once in a while because it can be fun to over indulge.  i was born and raised in north carolina. it's a southern state, despite its name. sweet tea and fried foods...mmmmm. sadly my desire to eat healthy outweighs my lust for southern cooking. but whenever i go home i make sure to get some bar-b-que!  i'm looking for some one...similar? i don't need to have everything in common because individuality brings some spice to the table otherwise we'd be bland and boring; someone who takes care of themselves physically, who knows how to laugh and enjoy themselves, but puts their nose to the grindstone when need be. intelligence is sexy. professionally: i'm a small animal veterinarian (read: dogs and cats) on the peninsula. i really like my job. i find it very rewarding and constantly challenging. i learn something new daily.  personally: i'm trying to find more like-minded folks my age. otherwise i work hard (gym time) to play hard (going out). puns. and divulging just a little too much info...sometimes i truly lack a filter. i don't know. nobody's ever told me. i think it's my eyes. (kidding) books: life of pi, art of racing in the rain, song of ice and fire (series), down river, hearts over atlantis, a painted house, the alchemist (no, i don't remember all the author's names)  movies: inception, anchorman, fight club, monte python's search for the holy grail, princess bride shows: the daily show with jon stewart, mad men  music: i enjoy classic rock the most, but i have pandora stations for rap/hip hop, country, sinatra types, and bach-esque sounds. when i hear music i feel the need to move. i have been called an inverted oreo, but i know some ballroom stuff as well.  food: i'll try anything once! currently i have found that almost anything wrapped into a burrito is delicious (including tikki masala). friends /family food (cooking and eating) wheels/shoes (always on the move) laughter interwebs ... what makes others tick? what makes me tick? what am i going to do this weekend? what's for dinner? where do i find the kinds of people that i enjoy hanging out with? at what point should i stop saying that i'm \"new to the area\". i don't think there is a typical friday night. i'd prefer to be with friends, but it can range anywhere from going up to the city to chilling at home watching some netflix. just ask. i have lots of embarrassing stories. you like what you've seen and want to see/know more.\n",

      "hi....  i am an expat living in san francisco for the last 8 years. before then i lived in england for 8 years and before then was in scotland where i was born. i spent a few months in bolivia after college too. all and all i am pretty aware of what is going on in the world today and am interested in people who are interested in the world, not just with what is going on in this land.  i have a good life with great friends, a great home, a great job and i am healthy. i am a happy guy and am both light hearted and thoughtful. i have a strong set of values which include hard work, discipline, sacrifice, love, family, education, trust, nature, active listening, humbleness, intellectual curiosity, honesty, laughter and joy, spirituality and passion.  while i am always open to new friends, i am really looking for a new best friend, partner and lover. i am looking for someone who shares many of my values but also compliments those with their own special values.  certain of my values definitely come from my upbringing in scotland. while my life is balanced here, with the right partner and plan, i would be up for exploring more of this amazing earth on a short or long-term basis. my new partner will definitely appreciate european ways (other than the accent)......hopefully you know what that means!  love and laughter! in my days i work at my career in real estate. i am a senior professional at a respected company and really enjoy what i do. that job gives me financial stability which takes off much pressure in my life. i own and live in a lovely non-conventional condo in mission bay (more artistic than cookie-cutter) and i have plenty of vacation allowance to use up each year. i really do leave my work at the door and spend the rest of my time checking out new places to eat in sf, acting the fool and being playful, taking in movies, occasional but not enough live theater hanging with friends, inventing and doing random creative projects, enjoying parks in sf during the summer, hitting music festivals, finding remote natural hot tubs, camping, drinking whisky (scottish) and wine too much or not enough, hiking and more. i love getting in the car and hitting the road!  keeping fit and being active is very important to me for many reasons. i go through phases of what i do.......yoga, pilates, gyrotonics, swimming.....and most so rolling around on my exercise ball while watching soccer in the mornings. i used to rock climb and run more, and perhaps one day will again. paddle boarding is something i want to try in 2012. first goal is to work on healing up an achilles tendon injury....more ultrasound and ice please, doctor! so frustrating.......but i must be zen.  working on the spiritual side of life and my heart are have been a focus for the last 5 years. i ain't no hippie and i was born with a cynical streak, but i am open to new things and pursue them with more regularity these days. i make an annual pilgrimage to meet a native indian in arizon and walk into the desert after eating his special cactus and i go to a meditation thingie twice a week. these things help me stay in the present and trust that all will be ok!  other than that, i am now looking at real estate investment opportunities in the inner mission with a friend. that is a hobby that is fun and fruitful (i hope). i am also working to promote electric bicycles in the bay area (www.yubaride.com), and as of this week now helping out a friend on their initiative to build a cacao farm in hawaii....did you know that kuaii is the only place in america you can grow cacao and thus make american-made chocolate? i am really good at balancing out my life and taking pleasure in the simple things in life. i am also really good at doing stupid things due not concentrating or daydreaming. thankfully these stupid things make for others entertainment, so overall it is a win me thinks! people initially notice that i am tall and talk funny. 100% that is the first two. but very soon after that they realize that i make them comfortable, like to laugh and joke, and can be a dork. movies: drive, carnage, district 8, city of god, shame, neds, raiders of the lost ark, get him to the greek, raging bull, rocky, inglorious basterds, jacob's ladder, midnight in paris. shows: curb your enthusiasm, spartacus, sons or anarchy, anything ricky gervais. don't watch much tv, but i do watch soccer and boxing. food: i love all food apart from junk food. defo a tendnacy for spicy that said. music: all live music and i love pandora for finding new music. 'novalima' are the latest favorite. - love - challenge - change - single malts - hot tubs & massages (one thing kind of!) - mum and dad (i am in denial here as one day they or i will be gone) being better, foreign travels, building a family, friends, politics, sex, how my body works, efficiencies, time, boxing, planning pleasures and reminiscing about them, and being a hero in any one of multiple scenarios involving beating unbeatable odds. hopefully on the freeway heading out of town for an adventure or having happy hour cocktails with friends to round off the week. if cocktails are the plan, then will generally finish the night early enough to make the most of the ensuing weekend. i really miss my family in scotland. it is hard being away from the people closest to you. you want to explore.\n",
      "do you seek to be intrigued by a man with a red beard. he who would hold a pipe to his left and a story to his right ... a notebook forever abreast; laden with sketches of dreams and musings of romance.  does it thrill you to look up at the night sky, and wonder where those points of light go. is it enthralling to be pushed against a redwood and kissed deeply: your soul lingering at the precipice of nirvana?  would you let me hold you at night as we drifted into slumber? could i rip off your shirt on a black-pebble beach just to stare at your beauty. might we take each breath in just to share it again? reality ...  ... is never too far away.

((also: red, pointy, goat-like beard and i stand 6' 6'' barefooted - gentle.)) i read to many books to list favorites. movies are rare, but if well done are awesome. i try damned hard to stay away from watching much television. itunes library current song count: 239,583 (music is life). indian street fusion, southern american and east asian (food). huge trees beautiful men tribe farmland holding hands massage trades you. awesome. google me. i'm sure it has the best dish. this giant of a man who seeks to love unconditionally all those who would seek love: who walks the earth barefoot and sings to his plants - might make a suitable partner in which to hold hands and walk side-by-side while wandering along the cliffs of a the coast of northern california ... or somewhere just as exotic, yet further away.\n",

      "i've moved around and traveled a lot in my life both in the us and abroad which has made me pretty adaptable, adventurous and grounded. i moved out to san francisco about 6 years ago from nyc (with a 9-month layover in mexico) and it's now the longest i've lived in one place since high school. needless to say, i love san francisco and northern cali.  i'm pretty balanced and put-together (have a great job, great friends, great family, travel a lot, overall a happy, sweet, optimistic person, etc.) but definitely have a quirky side that emerges every now and again. and i tend to like people that have their sh&t together but are a bit outrageous too. bottom line is that i don't take myself too seriously. life's too short. laugh it off.  chemistry is complicated and i haven't entirely figured it out yet (hence my being on here) but i guess what i know is this - i want to laugh, be spontaneous, try new things, be challenged, and be around someone i respect and admire. enjoying it. words with friends. you'll have to tell me if we meet open to everything. friends, family, cheese, wine, sunshine, travel my next vacation taking off for a weekend adventure or having dinner/drinks with friends i am smart enough not to post private thoughts online. you're not a douchebag :-).\n",
      "hello! i'm at a crossroads in my career, in that i'm a vp at a tech startup that just got sold to a giant tech company. as i ponder the market opportunities, i'd like to bounce some ideas off a wonderful lady. but first, in case you missed it under my relationship status, i have a spectacular 4-year-old daughter, who means the world to me. this isn't a package deal, she has a mom, but she is my favorite human being. oh, and my side-gig of being a science fiction writer is what i wanted to be when i was 12.  and so yes, i'm a huge dorky science fiction guy. i'm not asking you to quote star wars backwards  just accept that my first love was princess leia, in the white robes, with that skinny blaster. along the lines of being up front with my oddness, i don't do commonly accepted things if i think they're mediocre uses of time. for example, i don't watch tv, watch sports, or eat filler food. instead, i prefer occasional movies, actually doing sports, or going on adventures with my camera.  also, i grew up in england, so feel free to start over, reading this with a slight british accent. and i really don't look my age. while i am 39, new people and co-workers are pretty incredulous when i tell them my age. the average guess before i tell them is 32. it's either the running or the weekly pint of blood from pale teenage virgins.  i'm looking for a woman who can laugh at comments like that. and who doesn't have a posed picture with a drugged tiger. i'm serious about that. as well as empathy. it's huge for me. if you'e a medical professional or a teacher, you're pre-qualified. and as for what we might do together, i'm looking for something fun that has the potential to be something life-altering. if this sounds about right, just say hello!  j i'm a vp at a mobile/social startup, that we just sold to a large tech company. and i write novels. writing, photography, and massaging. but sleep is my superpower. i can do it on cue. that i have a slight british accent, and that i appear much younger than i am. latest reads: the omnivore's dilemma, blink, agent to the stars, born to run, the hunger games, ready player one, steve jobs, and catching fire. wonder, empathy, and love. individual self-determination versus groupthink. that and why the fellowship didn't just fly those giant eagles to mount doom in the first place. asleep. or giving some poor soul a glimpse of the real me. nice try, internet! you're lovely, passionate, and odd.\n",
      "i am a very high-energy, pretty intense guy, with a big, loving family and a big, loving heart. i need a ton of stimulus, and i am very risk-tolerant, whether in business, sports, or life. short attention span, highly intuitive decision-maker. and i can cook pretty well-- pot roast, risotto; it's all good. working much too hard for someone who has achieved what i have, but, if you love doing deals, you keep at it-- very challenging stuff, with big wins and big losses. but i am far from married to my work: i also play a lot. i have a big family in town, and we are very close. i run, bike, or swim every day; lots of skiing and surfing on the weekends. the dolphin club is my second home and my extended family! adoring and appreciating women, figuring out fun things to do, planning, getting things done, being there for my three kids (27, 24, 20), connecting with people i meet, talking, making money, learning languages. no clue -- you tell me. very healthy eater, and i will eat just about anything. travel is a huge passion: just got back from bogota and cartagena, with a side trip to a very cool national park on the venezulan border.  last book read was midnight's children, by rushdie. not easy, but worth the effort.  huge on live theater (more than movies): act and ashland subscriber. love to see art, but far from an expert. my kids, a partner who is nurturing but energetic, sleep, good food, wine, the pacific ocean, the sierras, life in sf, the fog, the dolphin club. why only six? all sorts of stuff - my mind is moving an mile a minute! my favorite fridays involve a quick swim at the dolphin club, followed by a nice dinner with either friends or a special someone. then head out of town to ski or ride or hike for the weekend. let's talk. you feel the urge\n",
      "i am goofy. extremely. and yes i love that movie. i like to make life interesting by making any type of joke i can think of. i also love to include people in on the joke even if their just strangers walking by. i even have an ongoing joke through out my life. i wonder if you'll figure it out while you read my page. my dream is to become a novelist/teacher but, i can settle for just being a teacher. i know that i'm not always grammatically correct when i type these things but a motto i've come to understand about myself is: i speak good, but i write well. although i think the most important thing about my summary is that i'm an honest guy and i really have no idea what i'm doing. i just want to find that special someone. whether it's a new friend or something more. currently i'm a student. i had a late start in life when it came to college and right now i'm trying to obtain my teaching degree. . i'm looking forward to it because there's nothing that gives me more pleasure then making a positive impact on someone's life. also i think it would be really fun to mess with students.  for example, when i'm teaching a college class i'll sit in the back and wait for students to fill in. i'll give it bout 3 minutes after we're suppose to be in there. then i'll just start berating the teacher. calling him out for being late and he's suppose to be a horrible teacher. then once i get some students to start talking smack i'll approach the front of the class and say, \"good evening, i'm mr. *****\" and just watch what happens.  the other thing i'm really getting serious about is becoming healthier. i've been running everyday and really watching what i eat so if someone wants to give me tips i would greatly appreciate it. i'm really good at telling stories. there's nothing i love more than sharing stories with others. also i think i'm good at spreading joy and making people laugh. i think i'm good at it cause i truly enjoy it. my awkward sense of humor i would have to say. this is a tough one. i'm a fan of stories. there is so many stories out there that i enjoy. if i had to list off a couple it would be. books: dresden files, night angel trilogy,anything by dean koontz, pendragon series, left behind series, world war z (still reading)  tv scrubs, community, how i met your mother, supernatural, new girl, modern family, merlin, alphas, warehouse 13, bones, chuck  movies: the crow, old school, anchorman, anything with jim carry, any marvel movie, anime: naruto, fairy tail, bleach, avatar, various others i watched as a kid. yes, i do not judge. any story is good to me.  this is really hard for me because i enjoy a lot of movie, books, and tv. i'm a story fanatic i love how plot lines are revealed and how the twist and turns work out. family/friends a job computer imagination humor jeff goldblum stories. i really do love a good story. i know it's a bit childish. i understand the difference between the real world and the make believe but i find it very entertaining to think about stories and how to tell them. there's always something to learn from a story. enjoying my time with either my friends or family. the occasional party. i'm not gay. but i do have a crush on jeff goldblum... like seriously... seriously. if you're honest, don't take things to seriously, and generally enjoy having a fun time.  if you hate reality tv that's a plus.\n",

      "i am a dancer- a balanced person with a tendency to attract the crazies. i am also a nurse, a caregiver and will likely help you out with pretty much anything (even if i don't know you). i love to sing along to passionate music in the car. i have the bad habit of helping with silly little things at the slightest hint of your having difficulty with it (like opening the tops of bottles, telling you where to drive for the fastest route, picking lint off your shirt, handing you napkins or opening the door). i am not over-bearing or neurotic though. just perceptive :). also, i seem to have an extraordinary talent for making grown men (and strangers in general) tell me all about and cry to me about their sad stories (be warned!).  i will go on pretty much any adventure with you, as long as it does not involve cliffhanging (or cliff-walking)- i am literally petrified when it comes to heights. but also trying to get better about it. i will scramble through the thicket for hours, will swim across lakes, walk up and down mountains all day only to find the perfect spot to hang a hammock or to find a specific tree in the forest. i also love to sit by the campfire with a cup of wine. i especially love the smoky smell from that fire in my hair the next day. adventures are always for the win with me. i am one of the most resourceful and flexible people you will ever meet. not kidding. ask anyone that knows me :)  i have traveled a good bit of the world and lived in many countries. it has shaped me tremendously, and sometimes i still feel out of place in this weird american reality. i think everyone should travel at least once in their lives. at least! cardiac nurse. yes. the war zone. blood and tubes and pain and all kinds of nastiness. go ahead. be intimidated. i am every day. this is not my dream job. but i am good at it. and i really do love my job. i don't love the nastiness. i love the human parts of it. grown patients crying while they tell me things they haven't told anyone, little old ladies fixing my hair, hours of heart-wrenching stories, taking their pain away, talking them through panic attacks, using my special hippie magic to make combative patients fall asleep, empowering patients with education, and furiously advocating for their rights. these are the things that make me walk away feeling accomplished. also, the people i work with are top notch.  i am moving to san francisco in a week!! got a position at a stepdown unit at stanford hospital!!! going there to socialize, to learn a ton and to feel alive again. eugene has been slumbering a little too hard for me. and five and a half years are really enough. see above. i am nothing if not efficient. i learned a word recently that i liked and that applies: bricoleur. i spin yarn, draw roses, i can spell, dance, read in three languages, garden, milk a cow by hand, and i sing in tune. i can hang hammocks practically anywhere, and i can fix break lines on my car if need be. my friend here says: i have rosy cheeks, i have nice coats and i don't dress like an american. a varied taste: tolkien, coelho, dostoyevsky, oliver sachs, michael ende, e. gilbert, anais nin, and many more. a new favorite and a must-read for anyone in the caring profession: \"intimate death: how the dying teach us how to live\" by marie de hennezel. that is one powerful (and useful) book on the subject of dying!  i am not a big movie person. i like movies, don't get me wrong- i am just not a connoisseur... also, i likely don't remember their titles... documentaries are awesome. <3 ted!! <3  recent music favorites: mumford and sons, florence & the machine, xxx, regina spektor, crooked still, moby, beats antique, brandi carlile, nickel creek, adele. pandora rocks.  local organic produce can't be beat! i really like to cook, although i don't always have time. also: i am a sucker for the traditional dinner date at a fancy restaurant. i am also a food snob. and i miss my garden. -i could never do without a sense of being able to get out of situation i didn't like. the idea of buying a house terrifies me -it strikes me as too much of a commitment to a specific place. -i like to feel good in my body, so high quality food, water, exercise and sleep, are on this list. -my immediate family is important to me, and we maintain close contact- my mom has become my best friend over the years. not the \"mommy i need help\" type of relationship. more the \"hey- cut that crap out and tell me what's really up\" type. -internet. ah, the internet. such a fascinating social medium. i love the freedom and creativity it allows for. -perspective. this is huge. if you don't understand how the world fits together, with all its frazzled, imperfect, beautiful and ugly bits, you cannot truly understand the person next to you. and in the end it is all about being connected and feeling understood. i imagine what people's lives might be like, i think about my friends, issues that i am facing with myself, admire the sunset through the maple tree out front... my move to san francisco...  i am ready to find someone who is excited to be in a relationship so that we can both grow and make it a beautiful thing! of course the chemistry needs to be there, and i value honest and open communication. i am truly a \"no drama\" kind of gal, so if you have drama tendencies, it is likely i will have little tolerance for it. i prefer to be with people who can self-manage. i like to get out of town when i can. i love the coast, the wind, different scenery, i like curling up in my sleeping bag somewhere in the woods in a tent listening to the birds in the morning... portland has been enticing, so on my 5-days off (every other week) i may be found riding my bike all over town to various tango dances, or having a nice dinner out with one of my friends up there. more recently, i have been visiting a dear friend in san francisco almost once a month. i love that place- love it enough to move there in just a few short days! :) my house is frequently a bit of a mess. no filth- just messy. the more exciting stuff you'll have to earn. you like breakfast as much as i do. no guarantees- i am a pretty busy gal. but who knows? new friends?\n",
      "i grew up in san francisco and have been slowly making my way eastward with short stints in chicago and rural ohio. life has been great but academia is a lonely venture and now i'm looking for that special dude. i spend my free time climbing boulders all while trying to balance classes, my thesis, and teaching a fantastic group of undergrads. i just finished writing something with 368 footnotes. i'm currently in grad school for a master's degree in architectural history and theory. i love my research but i'm always looking for ways to get away for a little bit. distractions welcome. i've just gotten into several phd programs and i can't tell if i'm making a terrible mistake or the best decision of my life. making needlessly elaborate plans why is it that almost everyone on okcupid puts down eyes as their most noticeable feature? books: me talk pretty one day, moby dick, the authority of everyday objects, the lottery, and the great gatsby  movies: http://www.powersof10.com/film  shows: npr! (but not prairie home companion it annoys the shit out of me)  i loved ken burns documentaries as a kid and i still do lewis & clark, the west, thomas jefferson, the shakers, jazz, all of it.  music: aimee mann, the arcade fire (the suburbs!), gold panda, fleetwood mac, the supremes, laura gibson, stars, edward sharpe & the magnetic zeros, mgmt, and anything on my john philip sousa pandora station.  currently on repeat: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awhwcolyq90  food: veggie burger with copious amounts of bacon.  my favorite words to say: admiralty, attorneys general, gemutlichkeit, pomplamoose, titular archbishropic, bro. in no particular order: i. amtrak ii. boat shoes iii. rock climbing gear iv. google books (the text search feature is a life saver!) v. noaa.gov vi. my bros  i used to list my phone on here, but then i spent time in a country where my phone was absolutely useless and i got along just fine. postage stamps, reformatting my cv, the weimar republic, amtrak, making up titles and concepts for television shows that will never be made, the honey badger, architecture at the 1972 munich olympics, targeted marketing, where i can get cheap and delicious take out, which combination of local and express subway trains will get me to my destination quickest.  just as an aside, these are jobs that i often fantasize about having: - chief curator of architecture and design at moma - investment banker - lord mayor of munich - conceptual artist - professional rock climber - agent for the fbi art crimes unit either out with friends or in bed exhuasted from the week. well, i guess i should leave something to the imagination. you know the difference between doing grown-up things and actually being grown-up.\n",
      "i am kind, humorous, but can be serious. i can hold a conversation about almost anything, kids are my life (i am an educator) i will try almost anything once. i love to travel, i a foodie. i like to talk, but can be silent, and family and friendships are important to me. i can be a good listener or advice giver. working, taking care of my sons and looking forward to seeing them grow up. i am growing as a person, i have entered the enlightenment stage of my life and i am embracing it with both hands. being a mom, most everything else you're going to have to wait and judge for yourself. my smile, and my loud voice anything by jr redmann i like all types of music, shows, movies and food my family, my freedom, travel, tv, music and people about everything at home spending time with my sons, but i am flexible it's private you want a friend\n",
      "i'm a recent college graduate whose trying to figure out what happens next. sure i've got a job (software engineering), a car, an apartment, and friends...but i feel like there's more to life that i just haven't grasped yet.  i just moved to san francisco! i'm living by myself in an area sandwiched between the duboce triangle, the mission, and the castro. i gotta say, getting to work by sitting on a train for a few minutes instead of driving is fantastic.  i'm a fan of long candlelit walks, biking blindfolded, and underground sunsets on the beach. oh, and cooking, dancing, wry wit, video games, and going out.  i am tasty, second adjective, and spartacus to be honest, i'm not a fan of this question. i think it only appeals to goal-driven people who have the next ten years of their lives figured out, as opposed to people like me who have their acts together, but are otherwise focused on living day to day trying to get the most out of this existence. dancing (both the ballroom kind and the sweaty, grinding kind).  making fun of crappy tv shows (third season of heroes, i'm looking at you).  being honest and open about myself. this is the norm elsewhere in the world, yet in america people equate stoicism with strength and are trained to hide their emotions under the veneer of \"professionalism\". bollocks, i say. i think my piercing blue eyes dominate first impressions. after that, it's a toss up between my wry sense of humor and my \"round, yet firm\" ass.  there's also a debate as to whether my hair is blonde or brown. i need your help setting this, for science. books: asimov and tolkien, but lately, i've been getting into david sedaris and michael pollan.  movies: most besides blockbuster action movies and anything whose trailer begins with an ominous \"this summer...\".  music: some of my favorites include radiohead, tool, dream theater, thievery corporation, kmfdm, massive attack, dispatch, pink floyd, nine inch nails, pantera, and sigur ros.  food: mediterranean is my favorite, as i'm from that neck of the woods. but i'm very open minded. women (six of them?) why people look so silly while playing rock band. have you noticed? jaws slacken, eyes widen, tongues lolligag, and sometimes, saliva drips on the floor. it's just ridiculous.  also, the other day i was at my parents house for dinner, and my 16 year old sister decided to tell all of us that it looked like someone had \"jizzed\" on her gingerbread house. seriously, who does that? at a bar with friends. or sometimes wandering in the city. drop me a line for better results; i'm not the \"blogging\" type. you're looking for someone to have fun with, or you'd like to know the origin of my name.\n",

      "here's the short version, i want a girlfriend. i have basically nothing but time on my hands, but i don't need anymore attention than you feel like giving. i'm a nice guy, i like to share and make my friends happy. i grow the best buds and smoke them everyday. i'm not lazy and i'm always down for a new and exciting adventure. feel free to read my ramblings.  you should ask me. i'll tell you anything you want to know. most people's first impression is i look young, immature or some other wrong assumption. you should try getting to know me before you judge me, you'd be surprised. don't go off my profile that i got stoned and typed up in minutes. i'm a catch. i know that because all my ex's told me that, and so did there friends. i don't know know what to say to different myself from the dipshits on here. but you should meet me. i might just be able to restore some small faith in you for real men. i'm not trying to be cynical, but it seems like the only girls i would date on here are never interested. even though those are normally the girls i date when not meeting off the internet. i have standards and won't just settle for anything that comes my way. that doesn't mean you have to be a model and fuck me all the time. it simply means, i want to be interested in someone more than for just a night.  i like hearing horror stories from dates off of here. sadly i've had more bad than good so far. i don't get the point of trying to make your pictures look better than you really are. it's deceiving. it's not all about looks, but there has to be mutual attraction. if anything my pictures look worse or exactly like me. most girls have said i'm a lot more handsome in person than my photos. i enjoy looking good.  anyways. i'm not just looking for sex. and i'm not looking to get married within the next year or two. i want to take things day by day. if we like each other, we'll keep talking to each other. and if i'm talking to you, then i'm not talking to any other girls. i want some to go out and do things with. seeing movies, going out to dinner and such aren't exactly the same by yourself. i'm used to being in a relationship. i was focusing on work, taking a break. now i'm starting to miss having someone to spend time with, wake up next to, go out with and have fun. i want someone i can trust and be my friend. and have mind blowing amazing sex too. i can say without any ego, if i want to, i can easily give you the best sexual experience of your life. sex without love is as meaningless as love without sex. i don't lie. i'm not a man-whore though. seriously, girls have told me they've never orgasmed during sex, i change that statement within minutes and then many times over. i don't just fuck like a porn star, i'm hung like one too. i really enjoy giving pleasure and i'm great at it. it makes me happy, to make someone i like happy.  i'm down for just friends too. all mine right now are in their 30's, mostly married and some with kids. besides the occasional weekend or playing golf, none of them are too social. i get out and do stuff by myself, but its not usually half as fun. if i knew anyone here closer to my age i probably wouldn't be on here.  about me. i am 23. moved out here to follow my dreams. lived here two years now. just moved into the city from oakland. i plan on being in the bay area for quite a while. till i have enough to move to europe. i play golf every week with a few shots of jack daniels and a bowl or three of herb, with some friends. i'm going to go to college for agricultural studies. right now i currently am growing medicine for local dispensaries. i'd like to have a farm, really a winery as well as my special garden. i'm not some dipshit with a plant in his closet. i've been studying how to grow since i was 14 and have always planned on growing. originally i was going to head up to canada, but fuck that. california is where its at. i'm great at what i do and i work my ass off. people think it's as easy as water, wait, cut, smoke. well your wrong. a lot goes into it and you need to know what your doing and have the time dedicated to do it if you want to make a living. i take care of my plants like their my babies. i support myself, am my own boss, i work my ass of at night and have all day to spend as i wish. i consider myself lucky for being able to live of something i love and have a passion for instead of being stuck in some cubicle the rest of my life. i feel like i've already said too much, but let's just say i make enough to live and have an excellent time while living.  i'll get the two \"negatives\" about me out of the way 1. i smoke pot - luckily it doesn't really affect me other than i feel fantastic. i don't get retarded or lazy like some. 2. i'm skinny - really if that's a negative, fuck you! oh and i mean that in the nicest way possible. i eat like a fat ass. i eat breakfast, brunch, lunch, supper and dinner. and someday soon my metabolism is going to catch up with me and i won't be able to eat in-n-out burger and ben and jerrys everyday. stick with me till then and i have an even sexier body. having a good time being alive gardening, cooking, kissing, relaxing my eyes or that i'm skinny hunter s. thompson - the man  movies - good ones, i'm a huge movie buff, way too many to list. if i had to choose it would be between slaughter house 5, clockwork orange and dr.strangelove  music- again, good stuff. i'll listen to anything except pop, country, and emo stuff. my favorite is bob dylan and grateful dead, but i listen to a lot of rap and classical, getting into jazz, and i like a lot of 'indie'.  food - favorite has to be homemade biscuits and gravy with bacon. good times good buds good friends sunshine rainy days happiness work. things i want to accomplish. out i'm willing to meet girls off the internet. you're cute and have a awesome personality. and you're willing to meet in person.\n",

      "i'm an athletic, fit, pretty smart guy (well, at least well- educated).  my two wonderful boys (21 and 19), whom i believe i have raised well and who possess good values now, are just about fully grown, so it's time to replace trips to youth football fields, basketball courts and baseball parks to get back to things that dad and his significant other want to do. this would include trips to nearby mountains (ski), lakes, the ocean and cities as well as just interesting areas. i like to attend films and live music events too and i like to dine out some..a nice restaurant or a hole-in-the-wall with good food. i've always found such activities to be so much more fun when i've been accompanied by a woman i enjoy. i like interesting conversation.  i'm active. i play basketball and love the team sport thing but i also like individual sports and would like to a find female companion who might want to join me in some of these: brisk bike rides, hiking, kayaking, maybe some swimming and a little running. she'd also like to join me in a fun night out on the town or a fun night in. i expect that she will suggest some great activities too.  i like to joke around. but, my humor is usually dry, but i appreciate the goofy stuff too. i can be serious too. depends on situation, mood and topic! i haven't met too many women whom i can't make laugh at one point or another. and, i have a goal to make at least one person laugh every day (reminds me..i'm behind on that goal today).  i'm thoughtful and fun and find it very easy to be incredibly nice to a woman i'm attracted to and who treats me well. i'm trying to live it well, in a balanced way: work, learn, have fun, stay active, stay fit, enjoy and cultivate friends, explore everything and anything. life is too short. many things - both good and bad - come at you, sometimes in a hurry. so, i've learned its important to enjoy the good things you have today and try to build for more good things tomorrow, but also brace for things that might not be so good. develop coping skills. i'm aware that there are many people that have it rough so i try to be nice to people. live by the golden rule, though my patience is short with thoughtless people and with people who make really dumb or selfish decisions that negatively impact other people (sometimes including me). i am empathetic and a good listener (provided i haven't written you off as a kook (sp?)). i can easily put myself in someone else's shoes. this frequently leads to displays of compassion and suggestions about how to help that person, if they are in need of help, or brainstorming suggestions if he or she is just looking for ideas. i do not know. i'll have to ask them and get back to you. i hope they notice what a great guy and wonderful person i am because that's what i think they should notice first. but who knows? right now, it's probably the bountiful curly hair that adorns my crown - haha. i see an appointment with a person in the personal grooming industry coming soon. the stones, the who, the beatles, pink floyd, bob marley (most reggae), creedence, the kinks, marvin gaye, santana, clapton/cream, the dead - most music from the sixties and seventies (gasp!! they call them 'oldies' now! no they are not!!!). like a lot of the new stuff: jason mraz, los lonely boys, eric hutchinson, ray lamontange (a mainer!). love blues and jazz..coltrane, charlie parker, miles, billie holliday. some old country (hate the new country - top 40 country - wokq country - hideous). (go see the recently released movie 'crazy heart' with jeff bridges to hear good country). i'm softening on rap as they are merging it into more mainstream sound with a softer rhythm - a la eminem stuff. it is becoming more interesting, not that it would be anything i would buy yet. but, it's becoming more danceable, it seems.  dances with wolves, shawshank redemption, no country for old men, to kill a mockingbird, austin powers series, early woody allen including annie hall and sleeper (hilarious), treasure of the sierra madre, wizard of oz, citizen kane, cool hand luke ('what we have here.. is a failure to communicate.'), dr. strangelove, fargo, raising arizona (only great film done by nicholas cage?), one flew over the cuckoo's nest, brother where art thou ('i invented moral fiber.').  the simpson's, family guy, south park. i know some of the messages push the limits but they sure are funny! pokes fun at everything: right wing, left wing, political correctness. do not like much reality tv, talking heads (except charlie rose - i'm not always fond of his occasional fawning style, but who has more diverse, interesting guests than charlie rose?).  more a veggie than meat person, though i still eat meat. like just about all ethnic foods (at least how they are presented in the states). jalapeno peppers (sort of but not extremely hot), kalamata olives. these go on lots of things including pizzas, sandwiches, etc. yogurt with strawberries, blueberries and blackberries and a little honey. hmmmm. the positive feedback/love of my two sons. a positive connection with a fun, loving woman. many friends - i have many now but am always looking for more. can you have too many? the ability to get around, do things i want to do - i.e. freedom. staying physically active and healthy. the resources to make many of these things possible. 1. how happy i'm going to make some woman soon and how happy she is going to make me. 2. the rapid pace at which society is changing, driven by technology and it's impact of our social interactions (cellphones, facebook -- constant contact, focus on the individual (self-importance)). these can be used for good (sharing photos of the kids with family that's scattered around the world), but there are a lot of examples of them being used for not good or just waste. lot's of drivel! 3. i think a lot about taking care of the planet .. recycling is such an easy thing to do and yet there are frequently no recycling receptacles in public places and too many people blow it off! out and about...a man-about-town...a bon-vivant! gotta stay physically connected...with the sons...with the friends..with the world..with the potential light of my life! 1. i have a reasonable amount of resources, but i'm always thinking about having adequate resources in the future. after the experience of the economy and market of the last two years, and the way society and business models (traditional businesses failing, jobs moving overseas, etc.) are changing so fast in this world, it seems prudent to have these concerns. regardless, one must always try to enjoy today and tomorrow. 2. i feel pretty good these days! you think i might be right for you as an acquaintance, a friend or for the primary purpose most of us are here. or, if you have any questions about anything mentioned in this profile. our crack staff of customer service reps is ready to address your concerns in a timely and friendly way.\n",

      "living and learning...  i am an artist and a teacher, loving both. i feel very fortunate to have been able to make this life for myself, to have creative discovery as such an integral part of my living.  i am driven by the potential of discovery in the things that i do, whether it is in my art studio, through my teaching, or in exploring nature. i'm drawn to people with a similar bent on life, who are passionate about what they do, and are engaged in discovery of themselves and the world. the creative process interests me - how we come up with and develop the ideas that we have.  there are such great opportunities for exploring here - the east bay hills, the art museums and galleries, the farmer's markets. i try to take advantage of these opportunities, to make my life as full and deep as possible and to explore my corner of this experience of living.  want to share some adventures?

      "i teach stagecraft, and i am currently involved with restarting a twenty-year defunct drama department from scratch at a jc south of the city. before i started teaching, i spent fifteen years in the live entertainment industry (theatre) from summer stock to broadway. a lot of that time was spent as a lighting electrician, designer, and even some time as an audio engineer, but mostly as a technical director or a production manager. however, my discipline of choice through the years has been carpentry and set design. i'm an artist at heart and designing for the stage gives me the ability to express myself through what is essentially; large functional interactive sculpture.  when i'm not at work, i'm at home in soma painting, sketching, creating, looking for inspiration from within or from others.  sometimes, when the mood catches me, i'm playing along to my favorite music... with my saxophone in the theatre, or my harmonicas in my car. i'm not trying to impress anyone with my musical talent... there's a reason i do it alone.  i've built most of my furniture (from scratch... not from an ikea box)  i'm looking for friends, inspiration, new perspectives. i'm an intelligent recovering cynic. i seem to see more of the lighter side of life the older i get. living in my favorite city in the world and listening to the stephanie miller show every morning definitely helps. i love my apartment (no matter what the weather is like over the rest of the city, the sun always seems to shine in soma) and i'm walking distance from almost anywhere in downtown san francisco.  i'm not really in the market to date anyone having just removed myself from a relationship that should not have lasted as long as it did. but i'm not completely opposed to the notion as i've learned in life to keep an open mind.  oh yeah... my name isn't really seymore. teaching. expanding minds and opportunities. training the next brave generation of stage technicians how to hone their craft.  due to my career path, i've traveled a lot and i've called a lot of different places home. ever since i moved into education however, i've been using my new-found financial and location-based stability to travel for fun. i've been to costa rica, italy (all over), greece, amsterdam, ireland... not sure where my sights are set next...  also, currently trying (in vain) to make friends on a \"social networking\" [cough-dating-ahem] website where more people are interested in voyerism rather than communication [bleh!] producing shows and designing/building sets for live theatre.  offending people with my political views (well... not so much since i moved back to the bay area)  telling stories (most of them true)  teaching and running a theatre with a very busy schedule.  yo-yos i remind them of al pacino. to which i reply... \"hoo-ha!\" invisible monsters, the elegant universe, why not me, rush limbaugh is a big fat idiot and other observations, even cowgirls get the blues, still life with woodpecker, pan's labrinth, blade runner, glory, daily show, colbert report, always sunny in philidelphia, david byrne, peter gabriel, old crow medicine show, queen, dave brubek quartet, gene krupa... ah hell... this could take all week. if you want to know more just ask. art supplies, my power tools, my non-power tools, coffee, a means to escape or a reason to stay, my harmonicas the cosmos.  theoretical physics.  my art.  how the hell the gop continues to convince so many people to vote against their best interests (if that offends some of you, great! message me and tell me why you disagree)  what the hell is wrong with most people these days (that one kind of goes along with the previous topic)  my life. and what i plan to do with it from here now that i love my job and i love my city, and i have no plans to change either in the near or distant future. connect with me and find out i once listened to a micheal bubble (sp?) song and sort of enjoyed it... i've tried since to forget about the whole sordid affair and not give myself a hard time over it. you looked into my big brown italian/armenian eyes and you crave to know more information about me than my rather coy and aloof profile provides, or...  ...you're bored, and have nothing better to do.  either way i'll probably respond.\n",

      "when i was a kid, my mom would say \"only boring people get bored\" whenever we would complain about not having anything to do. in the end, though, this admonishment encouraged us to find interest in everything in the world around us (and to have little tolerance for other people who complained of boredom). so, if you're not bored or boring, but instead are excited by your life and love your job and have a passion for too many things to explain in a personals posting or a single evening over food but would need, really, months longer to scratch the surface of what you're really about, then maybe drop me a note. what am i looking for? someone with a talent for introspection, a decent moral fiber, a quick wit, a love of learning, generosity that is a little more tangible than simply generosity of spirit, a kind soul, an open mind, a serious approach to life but a goofy approach to living. and what am i like? well, here are some conversation points: i am a devout atheist, however, my study of science often takes on a near-worshipful nature. i was a volunteer instructor in a prison for five years. on a similar note, i was accused of bank robbery last year. but i didn't do it. i can wrassle an eagle. i used to do this on a fairly regular basis (and other birds, too). i can kick your ass in scrabble or pool. i like to talk smack about my game, even when i know i can't back it up with skill. ah, yes, and i'm about 5'8\", b&w mix, slim, healthy, good teeth. really first rate genetic material, as my father likes to point out on a regular basis. i am intelligent, quirky, and kind right now, i've just finished a phd program in biology but found the actual study of science to be isolating and slow. so i've entered the world of business - it's exciting to be doing something so new on such a high level. working with power tools, dreaming up and making wacky contraptions (part of my phd research was done on a homemade 'robot' called the magnipuffer 3000), and teaching people concepts that have previously intimidated them. the hair. it's just curly, but folks with straight hair are fascinated by it. that and i've never been mistaken for a stupid person, though sometimes i am quiet. anna karenina (tolstoy), a supposedly fun thing i'll never do again (wallace), plenty of dime store crime novels. i like a good indie flick or foreign film (delicatessen is a big favorite); but i also enjoy the absurd (recently enjoyed zombieland) and some blockbusters (yes, i saw all the harry potters so far). i am an especial sucker for any movie of any quality that is centered around a dance contest.  i like many types of food - ethiopian cuisine is a stand out that never lets me down, but i also like many american dishes, thai, vietnamese, indian, west african, spanish... how big is the world? at the same time, i can be a picky eater within any genre. i could do without anything. i take life as it comes. that said, i'd hate to try to do without: my sister, my iphone, and my good health. i suppose the ole iphone doesn't belong on that list, but to be honest it was the first thing that came to mind. how to fix the prison system how to maintain a social life as my work life gets busier looking for something good to do to close out the week: if i can find a show (i like comedy) i might do that, or i might go hang out with friends, or if i'm tired, i might just catch up on old daily shows and colbert reports at home. well, the thing is, it's private. if i admit it here it loses all its value. you'll have to work to get it out of me. i sound like someone you'd enjoy spending an hour with. here's an easy opener: i just moved to seatle, so i could always use a tour guide. show me your favorite seattle places!\n",

      "artsy guy with a sense of humor here. happily employed with our glorious city as a gardener. i have friends, family and 1.5 kitty named snivley in my life. i paint pretty pictures and refurbish old furniture as hobbies, amongst other things, such as being a pianist. a significant other would be great, but only if they behave and are nice! i also enjoy these self-introspective essay-type things a lot. i don't understand people's aversion to thinking about who they are. does it cut into their \"glee\"-watching time too much? what's up with that? as an evolved gemini, i've turned my evil twin into my foot-stool, which is awfully convenient when reaching for those things on the top shelf of life. so now the world's my oyster! traveling is what i'm doing more of. that, and cultivating more platonic friendships. at 45, i've kicked into creation gear, realizing that this life is as short as it is beautiful. listening. goddess, i can listen effortlessly for hours. it's the one thing that people really need nowadays. my smile - if i'm smiling. otherwise they usually notice that i'm not justin bieber right away. infinite, unlistable. anything smart and didactic that redeems the time it took from me.  music: 80's, classical, 70's funk, some electronica (especially tribal), radiohead, alternative, punk, most jazz, anything good!  shows: pippi longstocking, curb your enthusiasm, rachel maddow, project runway, frontline, the simpsons, strangers with candy!!!  food: japanese, french, vietnamese, betty crocker comfort food, witchetty grubs on a stick.  movies: black lizard, night of the hunter, sleeper, all kubrick, beyond the valley of the dolls, ran, house of games, meet me in st. louis, three women, freeway, blade-runner, blue velvet, the sound of music, bullets over broadway, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, ad nauseum......  books: the thousand autumns of jacob de zoet, the cloud atlas, when barbarians attack!, sarah vowell, somerset maugham, the amazing adventures of cavalier and clay, ad infinitum.... an impeccably clean towel. my friends. my sense of humor. illy coffee. the new yorker. the sound of distant church bells. the state of the world - and how not to think about it. relaxercising the pounds away. or, i'm over at a friends house playing settlers of cattan, drinking a glass or two of wine and trading witty repartee about our plans for world domination. i dress up in a moo-moo and spin around really fast, pretending i'm a teepee. it feels right. or if your therapist approves. you're prepared to sign a non-liability waiver. you're positive i'm the one your mother told you about. it blows your utilikilt up! you have a signed permission slip from daddums. you feel whisked in the biscuit!\n",
      "i'm very pro nature - balance and health through the laws of nature and everything in moderation (most of the time); pro wisdom, where applied knowledge and understanding leads to the strengthening of the self and those around you. in other words, always learning and being open to all possibilities.  interests: strongly engrossed in music, mostly of an electronic nature, but also some metal, world and old-world music, that which stimulates passion and creativity; and in short order the following: psychology, metaphysics (including the study and application of meditation, intuition, reiki, astral projection, dowsing, psychometry, channeling, energy healing, and other practices that involve being free and cosciously aware), holistic healing, nutrition, health, technology designed to increase awareness and health (such as binaural frequencies, cymatherapy, blood-electrification therapy, as well as the ancient alchemical technology like orgone accumulators, pyramid technology, etc.); as well as: creative expression through cooking, writing, singing, composing and designing; and the joy experienced through learning, teaching, socializing, sharing, entertaining, arousing, helping, healing and simply existing. :) oh, and of course video games.  important it is also to mention the qualities/virtues i value most, as these are most definitely required to be manifest in those with whom i may frequently associate/befriend: honesty, integrity, non-judgmental, forgiving, loving (or to put it simply, following the golden rule of doing unto others as one would have done to one's self, which first requires love of one's self), and also quite important is the quality of passionately seeking to learn and grow for the benefit of self and others, as those who become stagnant in this respect fall behind and can become a detriment rather than a benefit to those around them.  born and raised in the san francisco bay area (east bay). i've lived in the city of san francisco for about 7 years now. i work full time at a uc in information technology. i also love going hiking, camping, going to the beach, and other activities that involve nature. other things i enjoy in my spare time are photography and writing. i write quite a varied scope of things, depending on what inspires me. lately, i've been writing more comedy sketches. my earlier writing is more about psychology, metaphysics, along with a bunch of poetry. my inspiration for such things come mostly through being in the moment and immersing myself in whatever i am experiencing and observing in that moment. of course, if it's comedy i'm writing, then it would be putting a silly or sarcastic twist on it; which can also be enlightening.  i sometimes participate in certain types of activism, especially when it comes to environmental issues or civil liberties. i am very good at asserting myself as well as gathering support from groups of people. fixing computers, cooking, singing, channeling energy in different ways, making people laugh, encouraging others, being modest and therefore not saying too much in this section. my lovely, long locks. :) my often bold, matter of fact way of speaking about things. music:  i listen to mostly goth & industrial, as well as some etherial & ebm, some rock and metal, psy-trance, powernoize, and other misc. stuff... some of my favorites include: project pitchfork, die form, wumpscut, funker vogt, frontline assembly, absurd minds, delerium, covenant, massive attack, cocteau twins, snog, pigface (especially live), skinny puppy, the machine in the garden, ravenous, kmfdm, love and rockets, 16 volt, chemlab, the cure, depeche mode, bauhaus, etc... some other bands i've found i like are epica, tristania (which are goth metal) and knorkator (unclassifiable). i also enjoy music of different cultures (world).  movies:  i like a lot of different types of movies. i enjoy movies that inspire creative thinking; a story presented in a very unique way and which contains qualities such as future/past potentials/probabilities, bizarre and intelligent humor, a probing into the psyche and/or the soul, a universal truth, and movies that demonstrate magnificent accomplishments made through the strength and collective efforts of the protaganists. some of my all-time favorites are bladerunner, brazil, the star wars movies (especially the original 3 that inspired me as a child), the matrix (the original one), eqillibrium, perfume, the secret, batman begins (and dark knight), v for vendetta to name a few... i also enjoy a good comedy movie.  books:  i mostly read books on topics of metaphysics, astrology, health, nutrition, self-help/psychology, etc. some of my favorites include: matrix energetics by richard bartlett d.c. n.d., astral dynamics by robert bruce, messages from the masters and several others from brian weiss, health intuition by karen grace kassy, signmates by bernie ashman, prescription for nutritional healing by phyllis a. balch & james f. balch, love is in the earth by melody, how to see and read the aura, how to heal with color and how to do psychic readings through touch by ted andrews, spirit guides and angel guardians by richard webster, the intuitive way by penny pierce, think and grow rich by napoleon hill, and of course many more including a lot of e-books... i don't read fiction all that much, although as a child my writings were mostly fiction and delivered in a more cynically humorous fashion. i do enjoy some sci-fi as well. overall, books that contain useful knowledge that i can effectively apply, or books that inspire me.  i am currently reading the source field investigations by david wilcock, which is an incredible compilation of fringe research and science all tied together to explain the many great mysteries of the universe. i highly recommend it.  food:  i love most types of seafood and really love sushi. i also like mexican and thai a lot. i'm not a really picky eater, as long as the food is fresh and fairly healthy. i avoid overly processed foods, refined sugar, fast food, and anything artificial. as far as drinks go, my favorites are yerba mate, coconut juice, fluoride free water and i like good dark ales/stouts and hard ciders. occasionally a nice organic red wine. love, intelligence, freedom, good friends, access to natural health remedies, a hair brush :). comedy... by that i mean, i can take any given situation and twist it into something quite silly and amusing in my head. its not always amusing to others, unfortunately. that's just one of many random things. i often spend time not thinking at all (in meditation), giving my brain a much needed period of rest, refreshment and rebooting. i find that i am sharpest when i keep my mind clear. that is when intuition leads the way, and synchronicity abounds. it varies. i do photography for a monthly nightclub. on other friday nights it depends on my energy level, but i'm generally doing something of a social nature. occasionally i will just crash out early and save my energy for saturday. is something that you may get to hear if you send me a message. :) you are open-minded, honest, intelligent, and definitely must have a good sense of humor! also a plus if you are somewhat of a geek (into sci-fi, technology, video games, etc.), but also enjoy nature. it is preferable that you are also fit and at least somewhat health conscious.  you'd like to play with my hair. ;)\n",
      "let me start off by saying that i am a visual story teller. i have a background in art and engineering and i blend the two of them to create beautiful computerized images for the entertainment industry. i've worked on many films, television shows, and some commercials.  i'm quite passionate about film making. early on i absorbed all the classic movies and then followed the new generation of directors as they replaced the old. my motivation for coming to california was to pursue movie making, and i've had a very successful run of it here in the bay area (fifteen feature films to date!)  some other back story: i was born in new england, the fourth son in an extended italian family. i had the fortune of being surrounded by lots of relatives. all the wonderful cooking, laughter, and sharing made me who i am today.  -=-=-=-  i'm really looking for a partner who wants to explore, experience, and share the world with me. i like to find the fun in everyday life.  i can spend hours in a museum, but i enjoy going to the small galleries more and talking to the local artists.  i love to cook. i've been taking classes at tante maries cooking school for many years now. but, some of my best recipes come from my relatives, who are all excellent cooks. if i'm in a meditative mood, i find making a fresh loaf of bread very relaxing.  i enjoy a glass of wine while painting and i love to pick up my camera and roam around looking for that elusive decisive moment in photography.  some of the sports i enjoy are snowboarding in powder, biking the city streets, hiking the marin trails, kite flying my quadline on the beach, and chasing the frisbee in ultimate. i like change, so in my professional life i find every few years i like to reinvent what i do. i'm on an extended break from film and television projects. during that break i did some work in advertising and helped a friend get his games studio up and running. after self publishing my own iphone game, i joined a larger firm working on social mobile games. i'm really good at hosting parties. i'm lucky enough to have a large solid group of friends and i love hosting different themed events for them at my place or other mystery spots in the bay area. my john travolta strut! books (here are a few i'm working on, but to be honest i inhale books, i've powered through more fiction, scifi, and fantasy then i'd care to admit!): \"the diamond cutter\", \" \"why italians love to talk about food\", and \"the visual story\".  movies (way too many, but i'll share three): \"red\", \"amelie\", and \"eternal sunshine of the spotless mind\".  movies i've worked on: matrix ii + iii, star wars i + ii, war of the worlds, harry potter...  movies i've been an extra in: the mummy & star wars i...  music (depends on the activity!): \"bitter:sweet\", \"santigold\", and \"mum\" - if i'm painting.  food: italian, asian, and california fusion. (truly all types... but let's call that list my top 3.) pandora netflix my kitchen my canon my friends my family ( on some holidays this could fluctuate... lol ) probably a good recipe to try for dinner tonite... i really wanna start experimenting with indian food... i've never cooked it. fridays are all over the map... too much going on in the city to have a typical routine! maybe taking you out for a bite of sushi? sometimes i like to just wing it, but tell everyone that i know what i'm doing... shhhhh.... a partner that is attractive to me is one that has a quick smile, a ready laugh, is an explorer, a planner some days, and spontaneous the next. truly i am enamored by someone with a touch of craziness!  a few more ifs:  (if) you have a fun loving spirit.

      "hey how are you doing? i enjoy many simple and some complex things. most of my free time is spent outdoors during the warm days and sitting on my couch during the cold ones. on occasion, i'll pack up my bags and fly somewhere new just because. the best reason i have for travelling is \"why not!\". i get most of my reading done while on airplanes or on long car rides and solve most of my sudoku puzzles while watching sportscenter at home. i'm an advanced skier but prefer to take my time down the slopes so i can enjoy the weather and scenery. also, i'm worried about smashing into a tree or little kid. i am doing my best to live a good life. if i can help my friends enjoy their lives a bit more, i try to do that too. the best i think i can describe is that i'm living my life and not someone elses's. i'm relatively decent at badminton and ordering mexican food. also i probably know what's wrong with your computer and home electronics. i used to think i was good at math, but that changed real quick when i got to college. taller than average and i pride myself on a great handshake! not too soft, not too firm, just right. i try to tailor to the person as well. most recently read millenium series. loved it. i watch movies and shows your little brother would watch. the more explosions the better. i'm conscious about what i eat, but i don't let it dictate my life. no stinky tofu though. i don't like that. -my family and friends. -my lunchtime turkey and cheese sandwich -sf summertime sunset -game of thrones season 2 -my next travel destination -heavenly mott canyon -the next big thing at a local bar or watching tv. during winters, i might be sleeping early to ski/snowboard the next day. i watch gossip girl. i may have second thoughts about admitting this but i'll leave it for now. you like the giants. i'm just starting to use this site so i'll appreciate any profile suggestions too.\n",
      "hello! i'm andres. i'm a recent bay area transplant originally from southern orange county. people perceive orange county folk as materialistic, narrow-minded housewives and pretty kids with no ambition obsessing over first-world-problems. as someone who worked in the mecca of orange county (nordstrom), i can assure you that your perception is absolutely right.  so i left! sayonara!  i have a degree in psychology and social behavior, but the only thing i took from my college years is that i'm too apathetic to help people with their problems. i'm working on that.  there's not much to say. i am easy-going and can enjoy myself in virtually any context. i have good instincts when it comes to others and really value a person's genuineness over anything. own your shit, whatever it is, and we'll get along great! i'm working at youtube as a policy associate. essentially this means i'm spending roughly 8 hours a day taking down porn, horrifying violence and anything juggalo related. the rest of my time is spent in the shower rocking back-and-forth in the fetal position.  otherwise, i'm spending all my free time exploring the bay. there's soooo much here. i love it! i'm also learning fiddle! i am amazing at becoming a girl's friend and nothing more. if you could check in at the \"friend zone\" on foursquare, i would be the mayor.  i'm great at bad dancing. i'm legitimately good at violin. i've never lost a round of mario kart  i think i'm a good person. i tend to mirror others' personalities. if you approach me with warmth and kindness i'll reciprocate and likewise if you're a wise-ass. the first thing people notice about me is really a reflection of themselves woooahhhhhhhhh! current favorites: book - american dreams by studs terkel movie - the bicycle thief show - downton abbey music - jess hill food - everything in the bay area is amazing podcast - throwing shade  all-time favorites: book - the road movie - annie hall show - curb your enthusiasm music - jim & jesse food - cuban cuisine podcast - stop podcasting yourself i could live happily on chocolate and music and good conversation alone ways i can shake up the system  how high i can kick it's friday night right now... i've been kicked out of catholic school twice. once for getting in a fight in the 5th grade, and again for sneaking into the girls' locker room yesterday.

...must-haves include: intelligence, attractiveness, humor, spunk, honesty, humility, good conversant and overall awesomeness. being tall, genuine, into beer and not being addicted to porn are all pluses. someone who types and speaks in relatively proper english (provided that it is their first language). someone who doesn't need to ask where my piercings are or what my tattoos mean, because you should really be able to come up with something better than that to pique my interest. someone who can teach me about interesting things, who isn't threatened by a strong woman, who can be my partner in mischief and mayhem.\n",
      "trying to hide that portrait of me in the attic without ever seeing it. bonus points if you get the reference.  i'm shy, have a shitty photo up, am creative, intelligent, have a sense of humor that is often dark, and my current project is to make fake (i say fake because i don't believe in it) voodoo dolls to leave around the bay just to add a touch of 'wtf' to people's lives. no, i'm not joking. i'm seriously going to get the materials within the next couple of days. i'm bored.  i like cooking for others, reading, and pretending every time the fog rolls in that i'm in silent hill. switching careers, listening to comedy podcasts like wtf with marc maron, making this because i'm stuck around my family for the holidays and it's either this or i run into the ocean screaming. also writing, creating artwork, figuring out some code, and learning sudoku, which is not something i would ever think i could possibly be interested in. writing, cooking (except for the occasional experiment that goes horrifically wrong), making jokes (not knock-knock stuff, more situational, spontaneous ones), photoshopping things, either to make them funny, or for work. also, looking like a crazy person when i burst out laughing while i'm walking along listening to a comedy podcast via earbuds. seriously, i've gotten some very concerned looks. which only makes me laugh more. is my height. either that or my eyes. or that i'm zoned out reading or listening to music and very narrowly miss walking into lampposts and the like. some of my favorite books would be the black company series by glenn cook, the malazan series by stephen erikson, mysteries by stuart macbride, val mcdermid, john connolly, andrew vachss...  for movies, young frankenstein, lost in translation, dark city, in the mouth of madness, jacob's ladder, addams family values, and the lord of the rings spring to mind.  i don't watch much tv, but if i do it'll be 30 rock, dexter, battlestar galactica, holmes, jekyll, the venture brothers, arrested development, the daily show, things like that.  musically, i like a lot of things, but i'm primarily into industrial music. which, like all forms of music (and, well, everything) has a lot of mediocre stuff, some crap stuff, and a few really good things. i like to think i like the best stuff (hah!), although my tastes have been changing. lovesong by snake river conspiracy is a good one. or godspeed you! black emperor, east hastings (after the 'found noise' stuffs), system syn, assemblage 23, mechanical moth or diary of dreams, some wumpscut, some suicide commando, vast, pop will eat itself...  as for food, i like spicy food, mexican, thai, italian... i'm open to trying lots of new foods. i'm not into seafood, really, except for clam chowder or sushi. books, the ocean, music, people-watching, writing, laughing. also, i like abandoned and run down areas. i spent a lot of time in a place in the bay area where i would wander around abandoned homes and stores, listening to my music. there is a beauty in entropy and corruption. not always, but sometimes, and it isn't something i've heard many people express. whether housecats would devour us if we were smaller, or they were larger. i believe they would, though i still love the fuzzy sociopathic things. also, dreams, how we define others and their relative merits and connections to the world based on a wacky kaleidoscope of our own experiences, expectations, and emotional/mental development. that's not meant to be something deep, just an observation, and i have to put something here that makes it look like i spend long periods of time gazing off into the horizon before rubbing my chin and saying, thoughtfully, \"yes... it all makes sense now. i have deconstructed the human condition to my satisfaction.\" or something else that doesn't make this all seem like a shot in the dark. wondering why people write in this space, \"oh, opening a nice bottle of wine, watching an indie/art film while i ponder deep philosophical matters and plan my excursion to *insert place*...\" really? come on. sometimes reading a book, going for a walk, at a club. uhhh... if i'm bored on bart or any public transportation/lines i start rating fellow passengers on various scales, such as 'most attractive physically' or 'would flip out if we were stuck here for x hours' or 'would probably completely surprise me if i got to know them'. yeah, exciting, i know. you aren't batshit crazy, have a sense of humor, and don't take yourself too seriously.\n",

      "equally at home in the body as in the mind, i'm creative, intelligent, independent, mostly sweet (with a sometimes acerbic wit), grounded and practical, terribly silly at times, and very direct when it's called for. i can have strong opinions that i have no problem articulating or defending, but i can also be easy-going and flexible. i'm a huge music fan and go out to hear live music several times a week. i also have a lifelong passion for dance, though lately dance has mostly been losing out to music.  i try to be politically/socially/ecologically conscious and keep up with what's going on in the world. i'm community-minded and support local businesses and local arts & culture when i can. while definitely a city girl, i love to get out in nature too. i'm comfortable sharing spaces in silence and if we ever go out to hear live music, i would appreciate it if you didn't talk my ear off the entire night.  i'm a sucker for sweetness and have a strong aversion to machismo or anything that stinks of old world attitudes toward gender. a man who knows how to improvise in the kitchen is sexy, but (*if* i had to choose between the two...) i'd rather a man who cleans up when i cook!  guys i'm attracted to are often creative typesmusicians, artists, writers, and the like. (they can't all be bad news, right??) they're also usually younger than me, though i'm definitely more interested in men than boys.  while i get on great with kids, i'm thankful i don't have any of my own. i also love animals, especially dogs, though i tend to be allergic to most cats and dogs and can't spend significant amounts of time around them as a result. i'm trying to convince myself that i can overcome this with the sheer power of thought. i'll let you know how that goes. although i have a fulltime job that is rewarding on many levels, a parttime job, just for kicks, and many other creative projects i'm actively engaged in, i somehow manage to stay faithful to my long-standing slacker ethos.  it is reassuring to know that not all of my principles have weakened with age. i tend to be good at things i enjoy, or maybe i enjoy the things i'm good at . . . problem solving, organizing stuff (thoughts, events, spaces, systems), writing, cooking, listening, teaching, dancing, silly accents, parallel parking in spots 1-2 inches bigger than the car (watch me!), rolling the finest looking spliffs you've ever seen, hyperbole, making hats from scarves or tights, and balancing on odd objects in odd ways. perhaps that i'm tall? although my profile says i'm a mere 5' 9\", to translate that number into the measuring system most of you apparently use, just add 2-3 inches and then compare. yeah, what did i say? i'm tall. i always skip over the lists in other people's profiles, so i won't bore you with mine.  my job involves a lot of fun reading - analytic philosophy, social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and occasionally poetry or a novel or two. as a result, i associate reading with work and don't do a whole lot of it purely for my own pleasure, though i go through phases with novels.  as for movies, i tend to prefer documentaries or quirky independents, though i rarely go to the movies - it's not high on my list of things to do. i haven't had a tv in many years and have no interest in owning one again, but there a few shows i like to watch.  i go out to hear live music a lot, anything from jazz to classical to balkan to avant-garde/experimental to soul, funk, folk, or rock. i like to keep my finger on the pulse of the local music scene and i also curate, promote, and write about music. music is a huge part of my life!  despite the fact that in most people's eyes i apparently \"look like\" a vegetarian, i'm not, though i mostly prefer to cook with organic fruits and vegetables. for many years, i was indeed a veggie, but after a few years in your fine country, i lapsed into a moral weakness and began to indulge in animal flesh again. more than a decade and a half later, i have yet to be cured. **list alert**list alert**list alert**list alert**  -music -friends -objects worn on heads (no, this is not the name of some indie band you've never heard of) -a pot or two of black tea made with slices of fresh ginger every morning -knee-high cotton socks -garlic or avocados or irish butter or wine or herbs in the basil/mint family or assorted fruit crumbles served with freshly whipped cream (i'm counting the sum of disjuncts as a single conjunct here...) what i just wrote. (i tend to get obsessed about writing projects i'm working on and am a compulsive editor!) having dinner with friends, going to see a show, chilling out and cooking at home, or some combination thereof. see \"i spend a lot of time thinking about\" above. you have good intuitions. you know the difference between having clear intentions and being pushy. you're neither a flake nor pathologically late, but you know how and when to make someone wait. . . i know you know what i'm talking about.  or maybe that was a bit abstract?  here's something more concrete: i tend to be attracted to youthful, embodied men who are slim, my height or a little taller, often with dark hair, pretty eyes, and soft skin. (these are not requirements, just observed tendencies.) don't take it personally, but i'm definitely not into to hoary (that means you, old guy), husky (ditto, big guy), or hairy. and, while a fit body and a sharp mind are definitely sexy, it takes a truly heart-centered man to make me swoon. like i said, i'm a sucker for sweetness.  having said all that, chemistry and attraction are so difficult to gauge from an online profile and i've learned that what \"works\" in the virtual world often does not translate into the real world (and vice-versa). i'm not convinced that this is actually a good way to meet someone, but here i am anyway. . .\n",

      "moved to san francisco from tx in mid 2004. life truly is sometimes where it takes you, and mine brought me here. i am really enjoying it. i love my work, live my life and try to stay positive.  in my uniqueness i could spend an entire day hiking the hills or sitting at a rock beach starting at the ocean and surrounding scene, or i could spent some hours geeking out to a game if it intrigues me enough... i love museums (history nut) and the theatre(tis my work, and it can get intense at times). i will stand in line for the latest blockbuster mind numbing 3d imax movie. i am outgoing, rather perverse (in a funny naughty kinda way... always appropriately inappropriate). for the myers-briggs fans, i usually test out as an enfj. all this and more...  i am of humorousness-ness, totally extroverted, and a hopeless romantic... i work for a local bay area non-profit theatre full time. no acting anymore, all behind the scenes now, building sets/props and all that fun stuff. carpentry and welding are my trade. i craft/build/create and bring concepts to reality.  also, i have been building furniture for myself for a few years now. currently doing a small startup on the side with a friend of mine hopefully specializing in custom pieces. i find the work very rewarding to end up with a nice piece in the end and i have made a couple of small pieces for some friends. i like working with my hands...  i enjoy the company of my friends and try to keep everyone around me in a positive light. also, chasing after good times and good drinks.  i have really gotten the motorcycle infection running thru me in full effect... i recently acquired a somewhat sportier bike, oh the fun that is! the world and its problems just fall away and all is good.  i have been snowboarding a couple times now. all i can say is that it was friggin unbelievable. i was completely blissed out on another level of consciousness. oh, and i ate it, many times, some hard... still so completely rad. i am hooked... yea, i said 'rad.' my work, cooking (so really just ok here, but i think its fun to experiment, even better when it tastes good), computers/technology, working with my hands/building things, i give a pretty good massage but the foot rub is where i feel i excel, some mental stimulation working on (the easier) crossword puzzles, words with friends, making others around me smile and laugh, making a complete fool of myself (coinciding with previous statement usually), tennis (good enough i think), listening to others when they need to talk about something and people tell me i give good hugs, a master cuddler am i... my very blue eyes............... unless your coming at me from behind, because then i have been told its my \"behind.\" designer jeans do a booty good... the princess bride. other movies of mention are swingers, groundhog day(\"don't drive angry!!!\"), the first transformers (i actually shed a tear when they captured bumblebee, don't laugh at me!) and monty pyton's holy grail... \"what is your quest?\" as far as tv, shows i tend to watch the history channel, natgeo, comedy central and syfy. there are a couple shows i may watch but never get sucked in. daily show, colbert report, archer, real time with bill maher, boardwalk empire, game of thrones, the borgias and boss.  a very diverse mix of music. let me hit some of those around the edges: static x, little dragon, jay z, robert earl keen, duran duran, nin, enigma, dubstep, johnathan coulton, the smashing pumpkins, brooks&dunn... i think you get the idea... let me also state the the bestest ever string for pandora is harry connick jr. or the 80s one, depending on my mood. also, a huge fan of the hardly strictly bluegrass festival.  living in sf, my goodness the selections are unreal and seemingly limitless!!!

      "i take myself pretty seriously. but i don't think that's a bad thing. chances are, i'll take you seriously too.  i'd rather focus on the details than the big picture; the small moments are where everything happens. so, i'm kinda looking for someone with whom to have a lot of small moments (in addition to more monumental experiences).  i like museums, watching television, and reading contemporary novels and buffy comics. i'm originally from new york, which i don't miss all that much. i could use more snow and thunderstorms in my life, though.  a few strange quirks: i do not enjoy watching any movie made before 1980. my favorite songs, generally, are covers of other songs. and i recognize that there is a point at which food can become too spicy, but i hardly ever reach that point.  also, i'm an esfj (whatever that means). recently, i landed a pretty sweet job that i love. i've been thinking about moving into my office, though, 'cause i kinda never leave. i would totally tear myself away, though, to grab a drink or some coffee. let's do it. avoiding self-serving responses to vague prompts, deflecting with a joke, and talking shit. my eyes, my smile, my posture, my utter lack of a poker face books: pale fire, the poisonwood bible, at swim two boys, virtually normal, cloud atlas, the bell jar, house of leaves, brave new world, angels in america, the plot against america, brokeback mountain, the time traveler's wife, wuthering heights, the giver, the nine: inside the secret world of the supreme court, harry potter, the hunger games  movies: the dying gaul, children of men, serenity, i heart huckabees, v for vendetta, dogville, battle royale, dogma, kill bill vol. i, seven, the nightmare before christmas, hamlet, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, an inconvenient truth, contact, inglourious basterds, black swan  television: buffy the vampire slayer, angel, firefly, jeopardy, oz, dexter, top chef, battlestar galactica, the rachel maddow show, mad men, lost, true blood, pushing daisies, 30 rock, it's always sunny in philadelphia, dollhouse, house, nurse jackie, the closer, glee, weeds, spartacus: blood and sand, the walking dead, united states of tara, archer, game of thrones, the wire, american horror story, community, wilfred  music: bright eyes, m.i.a., fiona apple, rilo kiley, the faint, metric, the like, bjrk, ladytron, cat power, cansei de ser sexy, grizzly bear, feist, the knife, yelle, beach house, baby monster, la roux, florence and the machine, warpaint  food: burritos, thai, pho, pizza, sushi caffeine, rice, french fries, beer, hyperbole, unnecessary lists politics, boys, the law, sandwiches drinking beers with co-workers and friends after work or watching tv in bed, depending on how thirsty/sleepy the week has made me. i've been told my gaze is \"vampiric.\" i think that sounds awesome, but it was meant as an insult.  i most want to see what people most want to hide. but good luck trying to get the same out of me. ;) but, seriously, if you're up for a challenge/are a problem solver, that's going to benefit you immensely.  i can't help myself - i'm liz lemon. oh man. you have a beard (or scruff), an impressive vocabulary and an abiding belief in monogamy. you're authentic, trustworthy, self-aware and you will call me out on my bullshit. you're not instinctually opposed to second dates. but, you know, if the spark isn't there, let's just say that, yeah? oh, and also, deep, soulful eyes never hurt anyone either.\n",
      "the most perseverant philosophy i've come up with thus far is that everyone should enjoy life, however they can, with whomever they can, while they can, as much as they can.  sounds like a good premise to me.  i'm very observant, i laugh often, i care easily and i think constantly. i am an intensely empathic, logical, and sincere person. i'm often silent and pensive, and occasionally vocal and carefree. (this balance is shifting.) the philosophical bohemian and rational workaholic within me are constantly at war.  living a lot of different places (and thinking and reading a lot) while growing up has given me a pretty open perspective on life, and i'm always looking to expand my mind further.  when it comes to relationships and life in general, i'm exploring. although i am not averse to the commitment, passion, or determination necessary of a long-term monogamous relationship, i want to try short-term and/or open relationships for now (and, perhaps, forever). considering the fact that i'll only be in the bay area until mid-august, that's probably all that i'll get involved in anytime soon anyway. besides, i think more in terms of 'connections' than i do 'relationships'.  i know i want intimacy and connection. i know i don't want marriage, children, or to \"start a family\". i know i want to explore my sexuality. i don't consider this to be a necessity for romantic involvement. i know i don't want to deal with the mostly ridiculous rules, standards, preconceptions, expectations and rituals u.s. culture associates with dating and romance. i'm very open, and willing to connect quickly if that openness is reciprocated. i'm done dealing with all forms of infectious mental/emotional negativity for a while.  i'm a huge fan of open, truthful communication, in almost any context. - interning & 'workshopping' with the sf mime troupe. - seeking adventure. - simplifying my life (or at least trying to). - figuring out some portable, fulfilling methods for cash-making. - dual-majoring in sociology and interdisciplinary arts & performance. - figuring out how i'm going to fund finishing both degrees. - considering how i'm going to combine the skill and knowledge sets of both degrees to benefit humanity. - pondering my potential post-graduate endeavors. - compulsively questioning everything.  i'll be in the bay area all summer. let me know if there's some awesome place i should visit. communicating, cooking, video games, games in general, beat-boxing, critical thought, being calm, observing, writing, talking either too much and too little, organizing, depriving myself of sleep, etc. probably my demeanor; my neutral face is apparently a serious one. the thing i hear about most often is the way i speak. incomplete and lacking arrangement (but not verbosity):  food: delicious + filling = yes. homemade is superior. fresher the better. i like spice.  music: portishead, aesop rock, regina spektor, rage against the machine, hanz zimmer, zero db, erykah badu, basement jaxx, one day as a lion, ayentee, hybrid, bobby mcferrin, the seatbelts, el-p, avenged sevenfold, dave brubeck, a perfect circle, pink floyd, dj shadow, jeff loomis...  video games: tetris, katamari damacy, tekken series, super smash bros. melee, final fantasy viii, prince of persia series, littlebigplanet series, super mario 64, need for speed underground, bubble-bobble, kirby superstar, ddr, frequency, the legend of zelda series, and so on.  books/authors: when i was five i killed myself, fahrenheit 451, ender's game, dean koontz (especially the 'odd' series), night (elie weisel), one fire's wings (and the rest of the series i've read so farchristie golden), angels & demons, when will jesus bring the porkchops... also, i'm pretty sure a lot of my favorites are still on my ridiculously long \"read me\" list: the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, 1984, prometheus rising, einstein's dreams, principia discordia, george carlin, lewis carroll, poe, david foster wallace, philosophical classics...  movies: i heart huckabees, a huey p. newton story, zeitgeist (seriesaddendum the most), rent, 127 hours, religulous, spirited away, the invention of lying, inception, dogma, the matrix, killing us softly (series), wall-e, fight club, ghost in the shell, clerks ii, crash, batman: the dark knight, tropic thunder... seriously funny comedy is gold, and i take well to documentaries that deconstruct things i think i understand. not a fan of horror.  animated/televised series: it's always sunny in philadelphia, the boondocks, dexter's laboratory, scrubs, animaniacs, the grim adventures of billy & mandy, the daily show & the colbert report, drawn together, south park, courage the cowardly dog, cowboy bebop, looney tunes, samurai champloo... yes, it's mostly animation. also, seeing as i don't really watch anything nowadays, i have no clue what's current.  comedians: george carlin, ricky gervais, louis ck, bo burnham, reggie watts. (any suggestions?) - humor - music - critical thinking - nature - expression - interpersonal connections society, art, logic, food, how to do all the abstract idealistic stuff i intend to, what i'm doing presently, what else i'd like to be doing, how to get massages for free forever, how to challenge my willpower, how to think and communicate more efficiently, how to bridge the mostly vast chasm between sociological theory and practice, how to forge interpersonal connections across difference and stratification, meditation, self-improvement, how to use art as a tool for research and experimentation, things i want (to experience/have/do) in my life, people i want (to experience/have/do) in my life, and whatever else my mind jumps to. exploring the neighborhood/playing video games with someone/considering the underlying societal structures of modern civilization/considering utterly ridiculous nonsense as if it was the most serious shit in the universe/derpin' it up on the internet/any of a myriad of other possibilities/... \"typical\"? i'm making a conscious shift to spend less time carefully considering my options and more diving into action.  i've been investing a lot of energy into keeping my mind in the present instead of the future.  i'm learning how to experience fulfillment.  i'm willing to share far more private things with very little provocation. ... you want to. ... you think our wants/interests sync up. ... you'd like to share/collaborate on artistic things. ... you know any cool place(s) to do fun stuff in the bay area. ... you want to do some yoga/capoeira/improv/other liberating, exhausting, and/or hilarious activity together sometime.

      "i'm just another phd student looking for love.  i consider myself hardworking and driven, but i also enjoy quiet times and simple things. i can enjoy the outdoors as well as movies, theater and clubbing. i like reading novels, especially historical novels and science fiction. i also like tv and have what seems to be a vast knowledge of american pop culture trivia, especially regarding tv shows from the 80s. i guess i appreciate a healthy dose of frivolity every now and then...  and no, i'm not the one who kept calling gaga's name... i'm currently a graduate student, working to get a phd. i love academia and i'm extremely grateful to be where i am now. what i'm missing is someone to share my life with. i've lived my whole life in argentina and moved to the states to start the phd, almost four years ago. leaving my family and my friends behind wasn't easy, but i love it here. recalling useless tv and movie trivia, especially 80's trivia. but not just 80's trivia: i can name all 18 winners of antm (and many of the runner-up girls too). my eyes and lips, i've been told. my big smile too, when i smile (which is not that rare an event, mind you). my favorite books are gone with the wind, tale of two cities and the oz books; especially the wicked series! movies, shows and music: all things 80's. you name it. i also like more 'current' pop music, like britney and gaga. and i also like miranda!. my friends and family, my computer, my phone, tv, my textbooks and my course material. not necessarily in that order... surviving the phd program and meeting mr right. and yes, world peace too. hanging out or going out with colleagues or friends. sometime work has to be done, but i make it a case to have some free time to relax. when i was in high-school, i used to daydream about a musical number about abba's song \"money money.\" i had everything pictured out in my head: the cast, the costumes, the choreography (i didn't star in it, i was just the producer). i was very surprised many years later when i heard about mamma mia!  unfortunately, they did not go with my vision. :-p ...you want to get to know me.\n",
      "just the other day while sipping my latte in a local cafe, i overheard a man say i'd like to find a heart, mind, soul connection with a good balance of time alone and together. sounds terrific to me. how about you?

      "was living on the peninsula but just moved to oakland, much better. i like riding and racing my bike. working out, eating new foods. outdoor activities. physical fitness, and pretending to eat healthy. you know how some people are in between jobs? well i'm in between schools. i have yet to find my calling or to find a fancy full time adult job, but i'm having a good time finding out what i like. i want to meet girls who like to drink beer, both fancy and cheap. girls that dont mind getting a little dirty in the outdoor sense and will try or at least feign interest in whatever i'm into. just moved to the bay area from chicago, holy crap! not being a 9-5er if i'm wearing shorts its probably my shaved sun-tanned legs. otherwise i look younger than i am books? non-fiction for me. i just read \"into the wild\" and loved it. i like books about adventures. right now i'm reading \"dispatches\", but i dont read as much as i wish i did. movies are fun especially the ones where zombies get killed and shit blows up. serious movies that have a lot indie cred are cool too but i dont know which ones to watch so please suggest something.  music is funny. i have never owned an ipod or downloaded a song in my entire life. it has been years since i bought a cd. i listen to all of my music on the radio(very well adept at top 40) or on pandora. some of the stations on my pandora; m.i.a., interpol, cannibal corpse, daft punk, born of osiris, the killers and so on and so forth. i like music and all but i'm very passive about seeking or obtaining new music i just let it find me.  and now a random list of very unrelated musicians that i enjoy. the sounds, pantera, metric, korn, metallica, muse, the strokes, yeah yeah yeahs, the presets, boys noize, gucci mane, crystal castles and anything that you can juke to, if you dont know what that is ask me. family dog bike beer food chocolate what kind of crazy shit i can do on my days off from work getting ready for a race the next day or drinking somewhere i've read all the twilight books and seen the movies you want to go out on a bike ride or teach me how to climb\n",
      "i enjoy chance encounters and happenstance. i listen - so, people like to tell me things - everyone has a story. i'm the guy you call at the last minute to say let's go do something. preferably, it's interesting/intriguing; and, i haven't done it before (or, if i have, then i really enjoyed it). sitting on a park bench and imagining stories about the people that pass by is always fun. lack of imagination is not fun.  i like to help people...don't take my kindness for weakness.  summaries should be brief. there are other summaries below. i just returned to san francisco after traveling for almost two years...a solo 13000 mile road trip throughout the united states...then cairo, dubai, and istanbul. freelance writer.  my mom was hospitalized, so i'm back. i'm trying to figure this part out....  i go to the gym...not as a meathead/knuckledragger, but so i can stay thin and healthy. writing, observing, listening, and enjoying a great story. i'm a good cook, but that's something other people should say, right? my eyelashes. some just blurt it out and others try not to stare. it's vital to have all-things-bmsmf in your life. i like introducing people to new stuff and i like it even better when someone can recommend new things to me - it's a huge turn on.  ...anyway, these films are keepers...true romance - one of the best scripts ever; deer hunter; apocalypse now; hearts of darkness; the matrix (trust me, we are all living it); king of comedy (the scorcese film); read my lips and diva (french films); my life without me; secretary; donnie darko; let the right one in (swedish) and, a whole bunch more...  ...i'm more into literary periodicals (like granta, paris review, virginia quarterly, zoetrope, believer, mcsweeneys)...it gives me a chance to learn about new writers...folks that deserve a chance and are yearning for an audience...  ...i enjoy music and i love food...listing every track or ethnic cuisine seems superfluous...  ...i stopped watching television shows after the wire and deadwood...  bmsmf is best talked about in person...that i wrote this much makes me want to erase it all. my five senses (i want to experience as much as i can) and long walks. article ideas. canadian citizenship. my tire pressure. choosing a neighborhood, walking around for hours, and stopping into whatever scene/venue that seems appealing. bmsmfing. ask - no secrets here. you want to meet....you want someone to check your tire pressure...you're able to laugh at yourself, at me, or with me...not laughing is not fun - which means if there is a seat next to me on the park bench (and, you lack imagination), then i'm really not the guy for you...  ***below - other stuff that was once on this profile*** i saw a handsome older gentleman walking down the sidewalk this morning. i said hello. he said hello. i told him that he reminded me of clark gable or errol flynn. he smiled, walked a few feet away, stopped, looked over his shoulder and said, \"i like you son, you have a great attitude, thanks for the compliment and have a wonderful day.\" ******** a teenager asked me to hold a piece of thick cotton paper while he lit a cigarette outside the tea shop. i noticed that it was a resume. i asked if i could read it. he obliged. i told him that his americorps experience was impressive. \"i've been walking the streets, looking for a job for three weeks and nobody knows what that is,\" he said. i told him that eventually the right person would. i invited him in to meet joanne, the tea shop owner. thirty minutes later, he walked out of the back office, beaming, and told me that he would start his new job on sunday. we shook hands. he was happy. i was happy. **postscript** - i saw this kid when i returned from istanbul. he was elated. he's still working at the same place (with two other jobs down the street) + some side gigs/personal interests that spark his creative soul. he looks healthier, stronger, and happier....moral of the story: give someone a chance....for me, even though i've done a lot and seen a lot, this story is one of my top ten successes. really.\n",

      "i'm always active. i love being out doors. i'm a hiker, biker, soccer player, swimmer, and runner. i love ice cream - it makes me happy. cooking with a glass of red wine is my favorite thing to do after a long, stressful day.  i'm a social butterfly. i've spent the last few years getting to know san francisco. i love it here. i enjoy the quaint back allies and little mom&pop shops that give the city its unique character. i even like antiquing (yes, i said it).  i'm also a dork. i love movies and waste a lot of time online (like i'm doing right now). i make stupid jokes with my friends, read failblog, xkcd, fark, and other inane sources of 'news' -this is in addition to the-much-more-stuffy nytimes, cnn.com, economist, etc. who knows!  i run a law firm which i created a year ago. i love the people i work with and really enjoy building things (i help people start businesses). i push myself, and i hope it shows. however, i'm not sure i'll be doing this forever. we'll just have to see. i'm really good at/with people. i can hold a conversation with a complete stranger (so long as i don't get bored) for as long as i want.  other than that, i try to excel at whatever i do. soccer, biking, skiing, eating food (you can actually be good at this! look at babies, what a mess!) i'm a big dude.  i'm 6'4\" tall. i'm a bold 230lbs. you'll see me coming, guaranteed. i love most of the food that i cook...most. spanish cooking is my fav. paella. yum. tortilla de patatas. double yum.  books: i read too much, but its mostly law related. when i actually enjoy reading its usually history or the occasional fiction. dare i say i'm a harry potter fan? (oh yes...i done said it)  movies: i'm a snob. i don't like most romance/action movies because they all have the same, stupid, predictable plot. give me 'the usual suspects', 'black swan', 'love actually' any day. but if you sit me down to watch 'you've got mail' i'd probably walk out.  music? i'm a child of the 90's grunge scene. i saw nirvana live when i was 7 years old. i'm a transplant from seattle. that's where my head is at. also - any type of live music i'm always down for. skiing. food. success and failure. conversation. music. the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy. what to write in blank spaces like these. out with friends. polk street usually. i failed 8th grade. if you're fun and energetic, have a good sense of humor, and like to laugh. if you're a smartypants, or think you are. :)\n",
      "i'm a silly, and easy going guy, born and raised in san francisco and looking to buy a place here at some point in the near future. i'm definitely a sarcastic asshole that likes to make the best out of shitty situations, yet i take things too seriously at times. i like to spend my time golfing poorly, playing poker awesomely until i get bored and give people money back, hanging out with my friends and going on weekend adventures. they do include vegas a bit too often. i'm a huge giants fan so i tend to spend a good amount of time at at&t park buying $9 beers. i guess they're cheaper than $200 beers at a craps table. (yeah, the beers are \"free\") i work on the interwebs and am building skynet doing systems administration and automation. why should i do work when i can tell computers to do work for me? i'm very motivated when it comes to my career and though i sometimes i want to just up and leave my job and go travel, i enjoy the type of work i do and the company i work for. i guess one just has to work around the politics to stay happy. i just got back from new zealand where i spent my month sabbatical, and oh my god! it was amazing! it definitely got me back into the spirit of traveling and exploring new places. being a wise ass, hitting golf balls into trees, procrastinating and troubleshooting stuff. i'm an open book, which sometimes gets me into trouble, but my closest friends would tell you its what they love most about me. i'm not pretentious; i'm happy, funny and light-hearted. stupid comedies, sushi, hip hop, but i'm open to whatever comes my way. people that are willing to accept others at face value. cut the bs, the game is stupid. tivo. fuck you comcast cable boxes! not bart/muni. i grew up taking the 38 geary. virgin america (best thing ever!) my shitty bars where they treat me well paychecks (i'm not gonna lie) what's to come? how could i have done things better? shit!! wtf am i having for lunch today? did i just say something stupid? do i really care? having dinner or drinks with friends, whether it be a nice place or a total dive, at a giants game, playing poker, stirring up trouble, on virginamerica.com trying to find a flight to vegas for no good reason. i can't sleep on planes? i don't know, i used to love flying as a kid, then hated it in my teenage years and my 20's, and can finally deal with long flights. still can't sleep though :( ok, maybe not that. i go to operas and ballets with my mom on occasion, and although they're not my thing, i really appreciate them. people think my mom and i are on dates when we go out to dinner/lunch, it's kinda weird. you're a romantic! you want to swoop me off my feet, hang out with my friends, learn something new together or go somewhere we've never been. but then again, going out for drinks isn't so bad either just to figure out if we never want to talk again.\n",
      "i was born in michigan, but raised in florida. despite one of those places having an additional peninsula, i am not quite decided on which is better. ok, that's a lie. i have less than seven concrete memories of motor city and some of them might actually be scenes from eight mile.  i served a brief stint in phoenix, learned about my inner granola in berkeley and am now in the city of my dreams, sf. i like to think i have engaged in a variant of manifest destiny minus all the cholera, rattlesnake bites and oxen not being able to ford the river. i can see why everybody has come out here.  i have a passion for travel and have been to 5 continents, but would like to do a bit more exploring domestically. i love to run and hike (i have done four half-marathons and have gone as high as 13,000 feet on foot) and consider my fitness important not just to look good, but to sustain my overeager eating habits. i enjoy watching sports and ideally this happens when i am surrounded by friends, cheese fries and beer.  on the whole, i try not to take myself too seriously because as soon as i do, i will probably trip in public, misuse a comma, or start talking about someone who is standing behind me. 9th grade teacher + grad student at cal + sat prep teacher i am an excellent hiker. i eat and drink very quickly. i am great with directions and maps. my smile. or scruffy visage. people also say that i am tall. books: play it as it lays, hyperion, east of eden, the world according to garp  music: robyn, kelis, nelly furtado, rihanna, juanes, guster, the rocket summer (i have the musical tastes of a 14-year-old black girl)  movies: wet hot american summer, life as a house, a few good men, camp nowhere, mean girls, drop dead gorgeous, atonement  shows: parks and recreation, happy endings, arrested development, pushing daises, game of thrones, buffy the vampire slayer, firefly, 30 rock, bsg, community  food: everything. except tomatoes and cucumbers. recovering picky eater. but especially burgers, thai, guacamole, pizza and scrimp. the internet. running shoes. sarcasm. friends. music. chicken. -why it is only windy during the day on my hill -how to steal exercises from other guys at the gym without staring creepily at them -whether my face is scruffy chic, \"i don't own a razor and am homeless,\" or \"neck beard is so 2008.\"  generally, i am pondering my next meal and then the meal after that. also, four meals down the line. a good night starts with good company. i like to think every night has potential for fun, but friday is the best day to combine exhaustion from the week with desire to embrace the freedom of the weekend. i can put both my legs behind my head. it's more of a spectacle than a skill. if you think i am attractive. or interesting. hopefully, both. and are not just interested in dating because you are bored. i am ultimately looking for a relationship. so should you :)\n",

      "long story short: i'm a nerdy business professional looking for companionship.  long story less short: after living my first 24 years in minnesota i moved out to the west coast (los angeles) to pursue work. i found a job creating a tv channel for the video game website ign.com, and have been there for nearly six years now. last year the job promoted me up to san francisco, and since i've been spent the majority of my time working and taking in the sites. now that i'm finally starting to feel at home in the city, i'm looking for someone to spend my time with.  for the long story on who i am, hit me up, i'm a pretty interesting open book. i work quite a bit, but i've found a way to pull back on that part of my life recently leaving time for more socializing, watching movies and tv, reading books, and doing some writing in my off time. my work. and making my friends laugh... although you'd never get it from this mundane profile.  what i'm not really good at: creating an okcupid profile. i'm either smiling or laughing. if you're not i ask why not? maybe you need to spend more time with somebody like me. book: no real favorite, i tend to like all books i've read pretty equally. but the last couple books i read were american gods, good omens, brave new world, and the hunger games. currently i am now switching off between the city and the city and catching fire. also, i'm a nerd, thus i do enjoy graphic novels/comic books (sandman is my favorite).  movie: i've seen so many, i don't know... godfather, casablanca, cinema paradiso, die hard, rocky, rushmore, jurassic park, shaun of the dead, the star wars trilogy, indiana jones, once upon a time in the west, south park, and really anything made by pixar. but when it comes to movies i could watch over and over again, i'd have to say the princess bride.  tv show: i used to be a tv critic, take that for what it's worth... (currently running) daily show, colbert report, breaking bad, mad men, archer, louie, justified, game of thrones, boardwalk empire, dexter, californication, south park, community, 30 rock, modern family, sherlock, doctor who (of all time) the wire, sopranos, deadwood, battlestar galactica, lost, pushing daisies, arrested development, futurama (not so much digging the new stuff), scrubs, seinfeld, newsradio, cheers, and many many more.  music: rock (everything from soft rock to alt rock to hard rock). recently i've bought albums by the fleet foxes, fun., tv on the radio, m83, the black keys. and when i need a smile i always go back to listening to queen or the beatles.  food: while my favorites are chinese and japanese (sushi), i'll try anything. family and friends sports my apartment my phone my computer and ipad the gym life, the universe and everything. grabbing a good bite to eat then going out to see a movie or hang out chatting over a drink/coffee. or just curled up watching tv or a movie to decompress from the work week. when i quit playing college football i pro wrestled to make a few bucks. you're looking for somebody to talk with, laugh with, hang out with, and settle down with.\n",

      "what can i say here? life is good. i've wandered, and i've seen some amazing things and had really good times. now, i'm hoping to move things to another level, i am looking for something lasting and deep that would be part of a life that i choose .  i'm not too uptight about many things, but i do have my own way of looking at the world which not everyone can understand. i think people are not as kind as they should be. i like strong, passionate people as long as they are kind. that's how i try be. i think i am loyal and dependable, i would do anything for family or friends.  i live an active life. i am gone, somewhere, most weekends. recently, i've been going spearfishing, kayaking, diving, anything in the ocean really, as much as possible. i love getting out of the city into a more natural setting most of the time. but sometimes i love to be in the city. i get mopey if i spend too much time watching television, reading, or otherwise sitting around the house. i need to be physically active or work out on a regular basis to be happy. i definitely have a thirst for adventure. working too much. trying as much as possible to make new friends, travel, enjoy life, do new things, push my limits, to be a better person. making things up, but not this, this is all true. seriously, some small detail, or phrase can cause me to visualize a whole imaginary story unfolding. i keep meaning to start writing. i can also find easier ways do to almost anything i work on. i can fix almost anything. i don't know, maybe i'll start asking. but some people are surprised that i seem friendly and very calm. (do i look like a guy who's edgy and has a bad attitude?) some of my favorite things in no order: electrical storms, volcanoes, clear blue water, the color green, olives, hot peppers, coconuts, hot tropical beaches, scotch, crazy passionate people, kind people, fiery explosions, flying, getting drunk with friends, shooting guns, mountain lions, whales, elephants, p.k.dick, borges, palahniuk i went to the desert once, alone, and with no provisions but water for a few days. this is what i learned that i need to live: the ocean, a breeze, one more sunset, a cheeseburger and fries(sometimes pizza), someone to share it all with, oh, and some sun block would be a good idea. food. other things... traveling and adventure the shocking, televised, destruction of the planet. the creepy religious fundamentalist/fascist anti-environmental trends messing up america (i don't have a word for it, but i don't like it) other things. out with friends in san francisco, oakland, or santa cruz. or sometimes sleeping in preparation for diving or hiking or some other trip. i've probably revealed too much already. you are kind and warm. you are not a narcissist. you are happy, sexy, and smart.\n",

      "what a remarkable age, the one we live in. here i sit at a keyboard, facing a computer screen, looking for someone. who? maybe you.  and who am i? i shall attempt to describe myself by describing who i am looking for.  i am looking for someone with whom to explore life in all its glorious manifestations: joy and pain, creation and destruction.  someone with whom to dance lifes dance--upon concrete streets at midnight--cracking the pavement.  someone with whom to awaken--beneath canopies of millennial redwoods to the sweet whispers of symphonic spring streams.  i am looking for someone who embraces the ebb and flow life- love and inspiration, suffering and sadness; someone who delights in the mystery of this ephemeral existence; someone who naturally elicits conversations that change the way i think and deepens my understanding of myself and the world.  i am looking for someone who challenges me to inhabit my truest self and to love as outrageously as we are all ment to love. i have been working in the solar industry as a mechanical engineer for the past 4-5 years, and was in construction doing green building before that.  however, i am in the midst of a transition towards working with people as a therapist/counselor- helping clients to open and express who they are  -some background-  as a youth i became interested in environmental issues, and, believing the solutions were technical began my engineering studies. this lead me through the career path that has brought me to my current work.  however, while in college and with the beginning of my meditation practice, i started to see that the issues were much more complex, and that the source of a whole lot of turmoil on this planet was rooted in mistaken perspectives and understandings within our human hearts and minds. this inspired my current quest and passion.  -the present-  i feel super-inspired to help people find what they most deeply seek. over the past decade of going deeper into my own process, and also with the coaching and support of comrades and teachers, i feel like i have become more fully alive, free, open, and loving. the journey continues, growth continues, challenge continues, and simultaneously i feel compelled to share some of the tools i have been given along the way.  a year ago i transitioned to working part-time as an engineer so that i could devote more to my study of the process by which humans transform themselves, to spiritual practice (meditation,qigong), and opening and enjoying life- dancing, exersizing, spending time outside, hanging out with friends etc. its been an amazing year.  i have recently completed a 2 year hakomi training (experiential, somatic, mindfulness based therapy) and am now starting to pour energy into building a coaching practice based on hakomi.  it is my first shot at a career working with people. it scares me to be slowly stepping away from engineering, a job that has supported me so very well over the past years.  simultaneously, by feeling the fear and moving directly into it, i feel more alive, connected, and excited about life than ever. designing stuff, building stuff, laughing really loud, loving people, loving life, supporting friends, challenging friends, following my heart, being present, fixing bicycles. my smile, my laugh. books: i am deeply inspired by most of the books of david deida- blue truth and the way of the superior man are both favorites that i can say have changed my life.  i like fiction but over the past few years i havn't been reading much for pleasure. i would like to change that. the latest work of fiction that i really enjoyed was ender's game.  movies: i wept a few tears when i saw the kings speech- shawshank redemption is a standby, as well as i heart huckabees.  shows: when dj's lay down tracks that are strong and deep my body moves and i feel good. however, i don't go to many shows- most of my exposure to dj's is through the ecstatic dance and dance jam scenes.  music: i love great artists in all genres of music. some favorites: john prine, tom waits, the postal service, blackalicious, jurassic 5, amon tobin, rufus wainwright, antony, leonard cohen, bjork, greg brown, michael franti, radiohead.  food:  i love the food of asia- indian, thai, and chinese are all standbys with ethiopian and italian thrown in occasionally for continental variety.  i love making mexican food and if i had to live on one thing for the rest of my life it would be rice n' beans.  most of the time i like to eat simple, delicious, fresh, homemade meals that include local veggies and fruit (organic preferred though i am no purist). connectedness and love of friends and family hot sauce meditation bicycles the wild blue yonder how humans change for the better. dancing with friends. i have an inner perfectionist that is a major pain in the ass and that i would just as soon let go of. the dude has less and less power over me but still causes me a fare share of grief. i am happy to say he doesn't measure others by the same standards he applies to me.  however, related to this pattern my easy-going intention for the year is to be less serious, have more fun, and to make lots of mistakes. you think we may be a good match.\n",

      "lo, the twists and turns. we continue to dive in and surface for air here on okc. around every bend in the road is a potential vista or...roadkill. i take those blind corners quickly, but i always honk first.  i'm a bay area cultural casserole ; roll up your bay area stereotypes, dial them back to 20%, interpolate them and you've got me.  meeting interesting people is awesome. you're awesome. your awesome profile... it's worth reading. and by awesome, i mean its traditional definition  reverence, wonder and fear. (do you see how i properly utilized those oft misplaced homonyms?) i'm looking for my girl; someone who will dig a deep hole with me. and if we dig deep enough, perhaps we'll find ourselves in the indian ocean near madagascar. i'm enjoying my career as a creative/marketing director for a horticultural start-up. my current job pulls together my previous careers in plant genetics, energy-efficiency and marketing. i grow food and flowers and tell people about it.  i love where my career has landed and i'm excited to see how it unfolds. i look forward to exploring more places by board, boat, bicycle and train.  i've been firmly rooted for the last 10 years in oakland. friends and i started a cohousing community and have been renovating our 100 yr old cottages together. solar-powered, gray-watered, and working on food-secured; those parts are easy. the relationship and conflict resolution aspect of it, that's the challenging part. it helps that i'm a good communicator, mediator and all-around compassionate guy. it's my path towards spirit, living simply and within community; it's work and so worth it.  i'm trying to find the sweet spot where self-reliance, adventure, workload and creative expression co-exist. i'm always surprised by my edges and their origins. meditation helps with shining light on the shadows. i enjoy getting outside and exploring the propulsive power of the elements and gravity. i used to be a snowboard instructor at heavenly and love the poetry of the board. i'm not hard-core, but i do like diving, surfing, climbing, paragliding, hiking. and any other activity that sublimates to transcendence; kissing, listening, dancing, watching and meditating.  i struggle the creative process and learning new things. but i've built up a nice toolbox for making stuff with wood and glass; which comes in handy for small and medium size diy projects. i put out an amicable, easy-going and confident charm that puts people at ease.  people also mention my freckles and spectacles, my smile and my ethnic ambiguity. i'm known to drop-in to a west oakland warehouse from time to time to get down and boogy. i like the indie singer-songwriter acoustic thing: brandi carlile, laura marling, foghorn stringband, sean hayes, gregory alan isakov, arcade fire, and bon iver are on the playlist. i also like the occasional old-time jam.  i read a lot of how-to books on furniture, design, remodeling, architecture, urban homesteading. from time to time i'll squeeze in some fiction when i can afford the luxury. some authors include, kim stanley robinson, audrey niffenegger, robert asprin, auntie amy (tan), maxine hong kingston. i also have my share of eastern philosophical writings and books on spiritual sexuality.  i love food from around the world and enjoy exploring new restaurants. i'm still learning to cook and bake more. pressure cookin' changed everything; risotto in 15 minutes, refried beans in 10m, split pea soup in 15m. the perfect pot for a lazy cook. i'm also learning more about wok cooking. thai, vietnamese and chinese cuisines are my favorites. my bicycle toolchest my banjo body wisdom compassion fnf how do i adapt my lifestyle so that i can continue to be a sane responsible adult whilst enjoying the vicissitudes of life? what fears are left for me to overcome? what's with the incongruities of idealism versus reality? how can i nurture my paternal side? what work do i need to do to draw my ideal partner? i'm glad i have answers and a plan.  speaking of plans, i also like to plan friendly gatherings for musical magic, movement mayhem or maudlin adventures off the beaten path. been exploring train routes on amtrak.. pacific surfliner, califonia zephyr and the coast starlight look like great starting points to untold adventures for camping, soaking, climbing, surfing and bicycling. i like playing outside! come play? i have fridays off, so i'm probably wrapping up a house project and cleaning up. and if i'm feeling social, i might be hosting a dinner party, grabbing cocktails with friends, going to the first friday square dance or hanging out at actual cafe with friends.  if it's a stay at home night, i might be having a glass of wine, listening to music, playing music and reading. i'm here looking for healthy connections; someone to move through life with ease, strength, integrity and depth. you appreciate the wisdom of compassion, tactful directness and the chaotic beauty of relationships. you're adventurous, soft and sensual. i appreciate the imperfections and contradictions of the human experience and you do too. i like the pre-date date strategy that starts out with a 30 minute casual meeting at a coffee shop, teahouse or bar. no pressure, no expectations... just friendly civilized connection. after that, if you come out with a glittered star on your tertiary eye, and more importantly; you're keen on me, let's hang and see.\n",

      "i'm an optimistic, easy going person who is driven to explore new places and have new experiences! i'm loyal, open minded and have a genuine interest in making people around me happy and comfortable. if i'm at a party with friends and see someone who's awkwardly hanging out in the corner by themselves, i'll walk up to them and introduce myself and strike up a conversation to try and make them feel more at ease. i love to hear different ideas and perspectives. i appreciate and respect different opinions, as long they are well thought out and not evil. i'm a total liberal, but sometimes i'll watch fox news just to see what the other guys are talking about, and though it sometimes makes my blood boil , i still find it interesting. i recently got back from a month long trip to thailand and fell in love with the country. as a result, i've gotten the travel bug something fierce and have decided to travel more regularly, i'm even toying with the idea of taking a year off of work to explore the world. my life has been full of adversity, this has made me very confident and comfortable with myself. i'm happy with my life and i place value on the important things, my friends and family. i don't take myself at all seriously and love to joke around constantly. most of my leisure time is spent with friends either, hiking, listening to live music, shows, exploring, barbecuing or traveling. i'm working in property management! it is a crazy, crazy field, you never know what you're going to get from one day to the next and that's just the way i like it. apparently, i'm really good at it, and am driven to continue and exceed my success in my career. making people laugh, communicating, exploring new things, getting out of trouble, making horribly inappropriate jokes, and typing out these self descriptions! i'm awesome at those ;) people usually feel at ease around me fast, probably because i don't take myself too seriously. oh! and my incredible good looks! ;) hmm....how to organize? i know! more bullet points! --- i love books! i especially love sci fi, but i'll read anything. favorite authors are john irving, alistair reynolds, stephen king and alan moore. ---- music! way too eclectic to pin down. yesterday i was listening to tupac(no i don't think he's still alive) and guster, today avett brothers and dr dre, electronic music and classic rock are my favorites, i think, but i love music of almost every kind. except country. i don't like country. --- food? i cook, bbq mostly, every night if i could..i like to experiment and try new things, and while i love my steak, i do stay healthy: thai, indian, japanese --- movies? la confidential, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, anchorman, zoolander..too many to list really. --shows, i love bored to death, curb your enthusiasm, lost, house. my friends trees the outdoors coffee my phone music traveling the world, and the next adventure. there are no \"typical\" fridays for me, it really depends on what's going on, live music, hanging out at a bar/club or at a friends house, even sitting at home reading a book it's all a possibility. most of my relationships have started as friendships and developed from there, also i am deeply frightened of squirrels.

      "hmmm...my self summary is i am very much so an individual some may even call me a bit odd. i have always tried to go against grain. with that being said i live a pretty \"normal\" life. i am a person who loves her job, very rarely will you ever hear me complaining about work. i spend a lot of my time with my family, friends and my dog. i enjoy all sorts of things, from hanging out at home (reading a book or watching a movie) to going on long hikes (or long walk through the city). i am a pretty good cook and like cooking for people, whether it is dinner for the family, bbq with friends, and a nice dinner for two.  i once asked a friend how i should describe myself and this is what he wrote: straight forward, no nonsense kind of a girl who can drink with the best of them, be true and honest with me and i'll have your back til the day i die.  that is about the most straight to the point summary i could be possible give.  i am fun loving, easy going, and honest to a fault i am achieving my goals on at a time. i just try to live life to the fullest and have a good time. i am great at being a friend. i am good at making a complete fool of myself, telling stupid jokes, talking smack, saying the wrong thing at the right time and saying the right thing at the wrong time. i play devil's advocate pretty well. i can keep a secret, and i'm a great listener. i am a pretty good judge of character. hmm i have no idea...i'll have to ask a few people... i am all over the charts. i love a good horror film with bloods and guts but i always enjoy crying while watching a chick flick. let's see movies: saw, the skeleton key, the day after tomorrow, top gun, grease (yes i said grease) all disney movie's i especially like the fox and the hound, the notebook, the family stone, the marine, the godfather, swat, training day...to name a few. when it comes to music i like everything from country, rock, hip hop, alternative, oldies to salsa. any given day you can hear my blastin' tim mcgraw, faith hill, shania, sublime, niravna, dean martin, elvis, girl groups from the 50's, lil' wayne, tupac, or native elements. truly i love almost all types of music. as far as food goes i will try anything once. i don't care to much for sushi...my favortie cooking styles are italian and mexiacan. i could never do without water, food, family, friends, my dog and duh disneyland. i ponder strange things from time to time. sometimes i will dwell on a problem or a 'what if' situation until i find an answer or solution that works for me. there is no such thing as a typical friday night. some fridays i will hang out with friends at a bar, or go out to dinner or go out for coffee. other fridays i will hang out with the family. and sometimes i like to kick it by myself, maybe go for a walk or rent a movie. i am pretty much an open book. there are not many private things to tell, if you want to know something just ask. you should message me if....you want to, if you are the type of person who enjoys going to disneyland and acting like kid, even if that means making a fool out of yourself. if you like to laugh and just like having fun. if you want to meet a laid back, down to earth person.\n",
      "if i rated you highly definitely send me a message. interested! ---------- i'm open minded. if you are gay, bi or straight. a boy or a girl. it doesn't matter. if i rated you highly i'm liking what i see. :d ---------- i didn't put so much time in my profile for nothing. please respect that and read it before you message me. (said with a smile) --- (all updates still apply to date)  update 6-18-2012: i've had a rocky moment in my life recently, so now i'm moving out of my boyfriend's place and moving in with two friends of mine who live in russian hill. that means my relationship is on hold at the moment. i don't know what that will mean for the future or what guys i will meet or want to meet. and how far i want to take seeing other guys currently.. but i do know that it's best for me to keep my head on the ground, take a little time for myself and get everything straight. i think it's good for me to be single for a while. i've been in a relationships since i was 15 almost non-stop. i don't think i'm ready to date right now so the profile/updates below still apply, i'm just in a different situation right now. i'm single but not in the right mindset to start seeing other people. but i am willing to connect with different people, so don't see this update as a command not to message me. i'd love for you to message me, especially if i rated you highly. i could definitely use you if you feel like you can have a positive effect on my life. i just want to laugh and feel good about myself again. i have to talk to people in my life who make me feel at ease and have no rush or don't mind taking things slow. if you think you are that kind of person, than i hope you can make me a little happier than i am now. i think i can only be in open relationships in the future. that i know. -- i've enjoyed the overall experience of the people i met through this site. even though i'm in a bad place right now and have to get myself together i think it's important to keep talking to people, offline mostly, but that can also be online. support and company can come from the strangest of places. it is always good to be communicating with fresh people and i do quite enjoy it, so if you want to give me a chance, male or female, i'm always up for getting to know you. :) -- here's a list of things i can't be for you: -a tour guide: i'm not really in the position to show new people around the city, being in a relationship, i'm sure you could see why that would be a little weird going out with a strange guy to all kinds of fun and/or romantic places -your girlfriend: i am not in the right mindset to be dating right now. that will just end up ugly for the both of us. i guarantee you. :p. i'm just not in the place right now and have to feel confident and determined about myself again. i hope the next year will do that for me. ----- the thing i can be for you: -a friend: as all friendly bonding that means we have to talk and get to know each other a little better, that takes time and we would have to build some sort of mutual trust, so i can come to one of your parties someday or hang out with a bunch of friends. investing spare time in a near future full of amazing times is always worth it to me. :d the guys who would be great to be my friend are the add/energetic/lively guys who just can't stop talking, have a lot to say and pull up random comments about random subjects to keep things entertaining. if you are the guy who catches himself saying \"i don't really know what to say\" or \"what's up\" a lot.. then you are not for me. :p -a flirting partner: i'm all up for playing, as long as it's known from the start that it's mostly just me being playful, i don't really feel like getting into another relationship or am ready to date at this time, i just want to have some fun without obligations. i just want to laugh without expectations for a while. i hope there are some guys out there who just want to make a girl feel good and comfortable. this is only for guys without insecurities and a good set of confidence. so if you are used to asking girls\"what do you think of me?\" then you are not really for me. i can only flirt and play with guys who have a some experience and are not easily impressed and tug a little too. :p. i am solely attracted to dominant men. a man is supposed to be in control and i have never been attracted to a man with a weaker mind than mine. i need somebody to top my dominance or i can be a little vicious, which is no fun for me. it really isn't. -- i really, really advise you to read my whole profile. if you do not there might be a chance i'll skip your message. i don't want you to message me because i'm pretty or cute. i want you to message me because you understand what i am about and still want to talk and build a connection. also i only want you to message me if it's in a positive way. if you want to message me with a negative remark/question, or you don't get something and have no further intent to talk to me. then don't bother. you will only make me feel bad or ruin my day. --- i don't like men who only put effort into things so that they will get something in return, selflessness is key. i need people who can appreciate the pleasure taken from the little things. i ask for people who enjoy the conversations by itself and can feel comfortable with the \"whatever happens, happens\" attitude. the main reason why i say that is because i prefer guys who are persistent, patient and want to have those regular talk sessions. :p :) i hope i spared you some time or gained you some by reading this. lisa. :) ---- notes: --- i want to say that i don't know why my profile says i message back \"very selectively\", because i message everyone back at least once. although i do appreciate something more than \"hey what's up\". what i also don't appreciate is when a guy starts off on a sexual note.. to me that's a sign of you not being able to have a proper conversation. --- if you didn't take the time to fill out your profile.. for any reason.. or you have no pictures uploaded.. or you have only pictures of your body. you shouldn't bother messaging me. :d --- i appreciate mature guys. well-spoken. know how to keep up a conversation. i dislike guys who \"talkkk lyk dis\" or think \"this is kewl 2\". or have nothing to say after \"how are you?\". please i have a bit of a pet peeve for guys over 18 who still think they're 12. it's just something that i like being taken into account for at least a little bit. i've been a teacher's assistant for a class with 2-3 year olds in preschool this past year and i really enjoyed the experience i had. i loved going to work every day and the children really kept me smiling so i decided i want to go to college. i'm starting early childhood education at sfsu in the fall. hoping that will get me in the direction i want to be. even though i said i don't like traveling much. i've been to greece (multiple times), london, berlin, portugal (last summer and this summer as well), michigan and belgium over the last year. but there is not place i'd rather be than home. the best part about going away is coming back home and i know that sounds corny but for me it's really that way. :) i've been hanging around with a much more adult crowd and i've found that is what really suits me. people who already got stuff figured out helps me and puts me at ease. i can't say i'm one for storm and chaos. i like calm surroundings and wise, mature people help to create such an environment. :) update 3-22-12: i have been taking a break from dancing and doing fitness (cardio) instead to keep in shape. :) -------------- i love to dance. i've been doing ballet ever since i was little. and i've been in a local choreography group for 3 years now. nothing professional though. :p i would say my better personal qualities are being very open, honest, caring and sensual. i like to tell people what's on my mind. but i do feel like i'm hurting someone's feelings pretty quickly. the thing i might be best at is just laughing a lot and enjoying myself. the thing i set out to do every day is just have a good time and i don't like too much bad news or hurt around me. i don't deal that well with sad situations. that i'm very warm and motherly. :). i've always been a bit caring and nurturing. i like to take care of a guy. i know how much guys wish to have their mommy still around. i won't hide that i'd like to have children of my own one day. but that's still far away. :p the thing i hear most is that i come across very motherly and nurturing. i have a bit of a motherly instinct that i've always had. i like to take care of people and i definitely want to have children of my own. being a mom is one of my biggest dreams in life. but don't worry. i'm not looking for a daddy yet. :p the second thing they notice is that i'm very bubbly and motivating. i'm happy a lot and i like to make other people happy too. so i just smile and try to make someone else's day. sometimes i find myself being a little too present.. but that's why i love a guy who will just tell me that i am being a pain in the bum and is not afraid to hurt my feelings or is too intimidated to say something about it. even though i get my way a lot i think a guy is supposed to be a dominant figure, it's attractive for me. as for the motivational part i would say it's positive manipulation. :). i try to blink, use my puppy eyes and pout my lower lip to get guys to do something positive, i'm not out to change personalities or make drastic changes in people's lifes but if i feel that a quick and easy change can make his/her day better than i will try to help. :) i wouldn't say i read too much books. i know that's a dealbreaker for some of you guys but i wouldn't say i'm any less intelligent because of it. i'm just not one for reading. i like having my own experiences instead of reading others. i've never really been into movies either for the same reason, the movies i do watch are mostly the big titles and that's because i get dragged off to see them with friends. :). i used to watch all the big shows but with shows like jersey shore and the vampire diaries coming on tv, i started to watch tv less and less. if i want to watch something i will watch netflix. i do watch the voice though, vocal talent shows are my guilty pleasure. :p i'm kinda into folky, indie and acoustic stuff. mainly music that you can relax to. put it on the background and just relax out in the sun while enjoying a cold drink. :). there is a lot i would listen too and here are a few examples of a few music genres and examples of what i listen to. (don't get mad if i put them in the wrong genre.. it's hard to define music nowadays. :p) -- old music: al green, otis redding. indie/folk-rock: the decemberists, joshua radin. modern bluegrass: mumford & sons, punch brothers. acoustic soul: james morrison, jarle bernhoft. indie/folk soul: wilderness of manitoba, james vincent mcmorrow. rap: drake, tinie tempah. funk-soul: jamie lidell, cee-lo green. americana/country/blues: pokey lafarge, lee koch. alternative: city and colour, maps & atlases. -sarcasm. -clothes. -wittiness. -music. -laughter. -attention. :p i spend a lot of time thinking about how i want things that i don't have. :p. i'm always looking for new things really. i should tell you.. that i'm not a big traveler. :p. i've grown to like san francisco a lot. and even though i do travel. i thought i'd point it out since a lot of people like asking me that question. :p. i always like to show off.. and there comes my big problem. i care about what other people think of me. maybe a bit too much sometimes. but that's why i love to tease and flirt because it makes me feel good to know i still got it. :p (bad.. i know) finally the thing i think the most about is music. i can't stop myself from singing a song. and even though it's not always too pretty. i do like to sing out loud in public. :p (i can't actually sing though.. i've been asked that a lot..) i've been spending more and more time at home, i think i'm becoming a little homebird, i quite enjoy what i've got know and when i'm with someone who i care for there is always something to talk about or do. that sound likes i lock myself up in my house. haha. :p. i get out, don't worry. i just love being home sometimes. :d. it's always great to have something amazing to come back to. if i do go out it's mostly at speak-easys or social bars around sf. i never really go out much outside of the city. i do go down south during the summer a lot but then i spend a whole day there basically. i am not really the person who takes initiative or is a real planner so when other people aren't doing something fun then i'm mostly not either. i am often asked to hop along and then i'm all up for a good party. :d well the most private thing that has happened to me recently was that i felt really locked up in my relationship and like i was trapped. i started going crazy and lashing out to people who did nothing wrong and i really regret that. now i'm out of my relationship basically and moving on to happier things. trying to end up in relationships that give me more freedom to be who i am. be around people who accept for what i am and don't judge me because my beliefs are different from the norm. then on a more lighter note is that i am quite insecure about my x-legs. i hate that i'm knock kneed... it's not that bad. you mostly notice it when i'm walking. -you're witty. -you can keep a conversation going and you actually like it. -you have the rough guy look going for you. -you like making a girl feel pretty. -you can refrain from talking like a 12 year old. -you can keep your thing in your pants at the start of the conversation. -you have something better to say then \"hey\" or \"how are you\"\n",
      "i am a serious thinker, but i don't take myself too seriously.  born into a large, noisy, and loving extended family, i now maintain a wide network of friends. however, i often prefer to spend time alone with my dog or sharing drinks and conversation with one or two of my closest people.  i am rarely dramatic, jealous, or angry. but i'm deftly perceptive and i'm always observing, sometimes judging.  i am playful and sometimes prefer the company of children. they are more honest.  voracious reader and i *will* write a great american novel. just maybe not the next one.  well-read and well-traveled, the former moreso than the latter. although my wanderlust urges me to remedy that.  i studied the great books in college. i've read most of the canon of the western world. i work in a home-office for a non-profit/global movement to end violence against women through theater and other artistic events.  but really my greatest passion is writing. i hope to pursue my mfa in fiction next year. making strangers feel comfortable. making loved ones feel special. writing. procrastinating. reflecting. making mixed cds. snowboarding (blues and greens) cooking. my super attractive dog, named gus. he is a chihuahua/boston terrier who has melted the heart of many a professed non-small-dog-person. the world according to garp the price of salt the anthropology of an american girl the elegance of the hedgehog plato's phaedrus lolita by nabakov don quixote the canterbury tales kierkegaard's fear and trembling beyond good and evil don quixote on beauty written on the body emily dickinson anne sexton etc etc  usually watch whatever shows i can find on the internet. some favorites: friday night lights, six feet under, x-files, l-word, veronica mars...  my mother loves olives and joni mitchell, my father loves hot peppers and hendrix. they both love thai food and peter gabriel. i inherited all of these. and here are a few i figured out for myself: ani difranco, sushi, mountain goats, mango salsa, brandi carlile, goat cheese, bon iver and so many more.  i love wine. mobility learning writing forward momentum intelligent and generally high-quality characters in my life playful diversions with those characters human sexuality. how we have barely scratched the surface toward understanding it. occasionally, it is the night for detox/retox: yoga and then a bottle of wine with friends. my dog sleeps under the covers. i don't think i have a type, but the women i tend to fall for are feminine, with a bit of swagger. i appreciate beautiful women, but charisma, intelligence, humor, integrity, ambition and kindness are the biggest turn-ons for me.  androgynous people, also sexy.\n",
      "my name is mollie. i'm a student at sfsu, born in norcal, raised in socal. i'm looking for new friends, and possibly a relationship :) going to sfsu to get my ba in criminal justice.  i've always had a passion for working with children, so i'm going to try to incorporate my two loves when it comes time to choose a specific career.  *don't worry... i'm nowhere near ready to have my own kids, but i do enjoy being an auntie! making cookies... seriously... ask my roommates :) my blue eyes i am a sucker for nicholas sparks novels <3 what can i say? i'm a romantic ;)  i have a lot of favorites for tv shows and movies! i love comedies.  tv shows: criminal minds, csi:ny, 30 rock, raising hope, workaholics, the office, parks & rec, parenthood, modern family, walking dead  movies: step brothers, enchanted, serendipity, the notebook, a walk to remember, dawn of the dead, i am legend, 7 pounds family, friends, my cat penny, clean socks, my cell phone, internet school, my future, where i'll be in 10 years... hanging out at home watching netflix or out with friends. i'm still recovering from a broken heart. if you'd like to make a new friend!\n",
      "hello and welcome to my personal ad. i wish i could go and fetch you a nice glass of wine or a cocktail while you browselike a gallery opening, or a harry potter partywouldn't that be

probably not for you (though i do give good email). i'm unconventional, never unethical, and i can sometimes be wrong, but i am never in doubt, but would you believe...humble.  here are a few of my favorite things (in no particular order & feel free to skim if you like):  wonderwall, baseball games, my garden, anywhere in italy, cooking, laughing, making love in the morning with the window open

well read, adores kissing, dimples, sense of humor a must, the more twisted the better. sexy. girlish. sophisticated but down-to-earth. attractive (sure, why not?). slender with curves. outgoing. naughty. yeah, naughty. in fact, a bit of a freak, but brilliant & charismatic, patient, pensive, soulful, and attentive. someone who can hold my attention sexually and intellectually. someone actively involved in the arts would be nice, as i am, and consequently a tad eccentric & bohemian. someone who is passionate and understands what it means to have a passion. someone with good underwear. someone who will probably want to wear my white shirts. someone who is au' natural, and knows that kissing is the new black. someone who will drop everything and head to quepos, costa rica

at love, love dogs and childrenhmmm, that's about it. i don't mind taking it a little slow and trying out the friends first thing. i'm tired of going on dates that seem like a waste of time and would like to find someone i click with so i don't have to sit there in some bar and get drunk (very rarely) and try to entertain strange new women several nights a week. make me happy and i'll do the same for you. i'm not perfect (far from it), but hopefully you're a lot closer to it than myself. and i do need is to find you attractiveyes it's subjective and superficial, i know, but there you goall my info is right here in this post. i don't ask anymore of you than i'm providing. i like slender women with nice bodies. i've got a nice physique and i'd ask that you do as well, but i do not seek perfection, unless you're my doctor, and if you are, there will be no excuses. i don't think that's too much to ask, but you'd be surprised. height is not an issue with me. i like tall women and i don't care if you wear ten inch heels if that's what you like. short women are great too. it's all good. oh, and please be nice, and humble with a bit of a wild side.  so if you'd like to respond, please do. don't feel you need to impress me with a long intricate emailunless you'd like to, in which case, please do, by all meansbut please tell me a little about yourselfexperience has taught me, if i'm not your type, no amount of time and effort in crafting a response will change thati remain open-minded. thanks.  i am happy, irreverent, humble and a good listener writing every day...

      "born in nyc, i was raised and educated in the likeable enough state of maryland. then i did some traipsing around the country looking in here, settling there until finally i made a return trip to san francisco where i've no been for awhile. i work for a living, play guitar and compose songs for fun, and writing is my somewhat difficult vocation. i almost always have a book in my hand* but i'm more than glad to put it down for some conversation. my moods are effected by the seasons and now that it is spring i feel buoyant, rather more life is for living than in the dark season just past. i think i will take up jogging on april the first. that is not a joke or a \"fool.\" one of these days i'm going to buy a boat. i'd like to believe there is a love of my life. i am not afraid of spiders.  *.  i am un, chien, and alusia reading obsessively, drinking socially, songsmithing, writing creatively and trying to make more money (roughly in that order). looking like just maybe i have something profound to say. also, occasional profundity. also, bringing women chocolate. maybe a few other things. definitely not exercises of this sort. my deer in the headlights look. my sexy dancing. that i know things i shouldn't. a) 2666 by roberto bolano is a fine book, my favorite in years. i also enjoy the works of nicola barker david foster wallace, neal stephenson, thomas pynchon and melville. so i guess i like long books. b)by sheer times viewed i'm afraid raiders of the lost ark would be my favorite film, however the work of godard, particularly le mepris, un bout de souffle, and alphaville score high as well. also the jerk is hilarious. c) i like music in many of it's myriad forms particularly teenage filmstars and, oh look, if it was on creation records i probably like it; bowie, architecture in helsinki, duran duran, prince, broken social scene, neko case, aimee mann especially and my own band hot farm. d) i have heard good things about food, supposedly it goes well with wine, of which i am fond of particularly the italian piedmont varieties. never? that's a long time and quite emphatic. but, uh, that most dreaded of all emotions- hope (love), music, shelter, cross-word puzzles, italian wine and er, shamefully perhaps, baby pandas. grown pandas are fine too, i guess. maybe i should put something about the love of a good woman (by whatever definition of that we may agree to) in here? lately it's been character v. psychology both in literature and in life. then how i should get out more, followed by song structure (thirds and fifths and whatnot, though music theory can make my eyes glazeover). a morning companion. probably, playing guitar while drinking a tad too much wine if you want honesty or whatever. it's vaguely possible i might be at the opera which i enjoy. fantasy scenarios include [fill in the blank]. i have this fantasy: i meet a lovely woman. a certain of number of dates follow. on the one in question we share a good bottle of wine and conversation. we find ourselves at your place and topping the pile of your to be read pile of books is the pale king, a book i have mixed feelings about. i pick it up and you notice and then we find ourselves in a most intimate conversation, and then... cavalier but kind, bookish but spontaneous, shabby genteel suits or complements your own style.\n",

      "doesn't \"summary\" sort of imply that it's over and i'm dead? or does hyphenating it to \"self\" somehow keep it in the present? ...anyway, here's a short self-ennutshellation:  i guess you could say my lifestyle is a bit \"alternative\" - my living space is more of a recording studio than a proper apartment. my only car is a cityshare. though i could afford a grown-up apartment and a car, those types of things have simply never been a priority for me. i'm in no way opposed to them - it just hasn't come up. i am, however, among the most stable people i know - i tend to not move very much (10 years+ in my current living situation, such as it is), and tend to stay with projects and relationships for a long, long time. creating and helping to create music. i am a composer, and i've actually made a living at it for quite a while. i do music for film and television - mostly indie films and tv commercials. i also record and produce local artists in the bay area. recently i've started composing for modern dance, which is having an ever bigger footprint on my time. when i get busy i get very busy, but the last few years i've done mostly music for tv ads and those tend not to take over my life like film score composing does. ...ironically, i watch almost no tv! can't stand it. i've been told by many people that i'm good at listening - at least i think that's what they said. [update]...since \"listening\" seems to be such a popular response on okc to this question, i'll add: i'm good at finding humor in any situation. if it's there i'll find it. i'm good at giving tech-support to my friends with macs - i do it like once a day. i'm good at making simple websites. the goiter. since i think people skip down to this bit right after they look at the pics (i do) here's a bunch:  books: a lot of art lit. \"on photography\" by susan sontag. (...sounds boring, but it's an amazing book) and \"accidental masterpiece\" by michael kimmelman to name two and then occasionally old non-fiction and poetry type stuff. \"frankenstein\" by mary shelley. \"the complete poems of emily dickinson\" by guess-who! \"night and day\" by virginia woolf.  movies: elephant (the weird ambient film by gus van sant. not the elephant man though i like that film too), soy cuba, el patrullero, italian westerns such as the great silence, the good the bad and the ugly, once upon a time in the west etc., 2001: a space odyssey, the exterminating angel, his girl friday or any of those howard hawks movies with overlapping dialogue, orpheus, rr (it's a 111 minute experimental film made up entirely of 43 static shots of trains going by. that's it. if you think this sounds interesting, there's something very wrong with you and you should definitely send me a message!)  music: music from italian westerns and other films. the last few years i've gotten into a lot of early and mid 20th century music - pre-jazz, ragtime, gypsy jazz and then classical music from that period - satie, copland, prokovief, ligeti (he's later i know) plus, the usual stuff: yeah, yeah, yeahs, arcade fire, pj harvey, pogues, the notwist, the books, pixies, clash, iggy, patti smith, joy division & all the new bands that sound like them interpol, the editors, etc. bjork, x and more of course. the latter, indie/punk/rock/pitchforky, artists are in my comfort zone musically (i was in bands for years), the former, soundtrack and period artists i'm finding more challenging of late.  art (random few): gerhard richter, paul klee, david park, joseph cornell, andy warhol, chuck close, pierre bonnard, mile bernard, henry darger, felix gonzales-torres, jean-michel basquiat, frida kahlo, georges braque, ray johnson, mark rothko, barnett newman, bill viola, alfred stieglitz, walker evans, luc tuyman.  food: i like to eat things i find on the ground. - iphone (boringly) - fastpass (now clippercard) - tacos (frm la taqueria) - elliptical bike - glasses - pores (i read you'd suffocate if you didn't have pores) creativity and art. visual art mostly these days. although i'm a musician, visual art really gets me going the last few years. i spend a stupid amount of time at sfmoma and art galleries and talking to artists when i can corner them. why? i don't really know why. i just like it. it seems to be filling a very big hole. it feels something like religion to me. since i've been working freelance for a long time. weekends have become an obsolete concept, but i guess i know what the question is looking for:  because i work at home, i like to try and get out of the house most evenings - so i guess, in this sense, every night is friday night for me. there's a lot of good music in the mission that i often end up seeing at smaller places. red poppy, amnesia, cafe revolution etc. i also check visual-art listings regularly (squid list, fecal face etc.) and go to art openings when i see something that looks like it won't be too annoying. i'll usually go to any art event that features, or includes sound-design and/or music-to-picture type exhibits. i hate this ipad. you should message me because i feel a little weird about sending messages.  perhaps because of a sense of propriety i am, so far, reluctant to initiate contact. i realize this is why we're all here, but there's something about approaching women uninvited that makes me uncomfortable. it's not that i'm shy. it's more to do with how i was raised. i never do this in the real world so it seems strange to do it here.  so please do message if:  if you want to hang out and talk about and/or go see art and music.  i'm open to whatever may happen, but this site seems more geared than i am to those looking for life-partners and/or sex-partners. i want those things too, but what got me *here*, to this site, is just wanting someone to do things with. somehow, expecting more seems like it would diminish the possibilities of what could come out of the experience.   please don't bother messaging me if you're a big sports fan - i'm allergic to the stuff. or if one of the things you can't do without includes the tv show \"lost\". ...or any tv show really. the okc matching robot really thinks i should hang out with jocks and people that care deeply about their \"shows\", but i shall not bend to the will of this robot.  and if you really thought i had a goiter when you read my \"what people notice first about me\" and you kept reading (!), our senses of humor are not in sync, but you have a good heart and i'd love to hear from you.\n",

      "i like the outdoors in the winter and a swimming pool or lake in the summer. i'm a morning person. i've never owned a tv. i'm a fan of contemporary art, like the type you see in art museums-- not the burning man type. i don't think i'd be caught dead at burning man.  i grew up in san francisco, but i'm not one of those fanatic \"san francisco is the best place on earth\" people. i like lots of places. i even like los angeles, a lot. i like that my family is here in san francisco, but the weather can suck it.  a friend told me that the username \"the6amclub\" makes me sound like an up-all-night drug user. i'm the opposite. it was intended to make a comment about me being an early riser, although i love a late morning in bed on the weekend. putting one foot in front of the other, and watching a ton of plants grow. running a small business and definitely not sitting on my hands waiting for things to happen. i like my work during the week, and i like my weekends away and doing new things. i don't like to sit around the house without a project to work on. i just started a big project that began by ripping my living room ceiling down.  i'm getting to spend a bit of time in the sea ranch this summer for work, so i'm up there one or two days a week which is like a slice of heaven. i can make my own furniture, and i know how to get around san francisco better than a cab driver. i wish i could say i'm a wizard at microsoft excel, but i'm just not there. in fact, i'm horrible at learning computer programs. hip girls usually think i'm square, and square girls usually think i'm hip. i'm neither. i just read all of steve martin's books. if you thought he was a funny comedian, his books will split you in two like a jelly sandwich (i learned that line from a 3 year old).  my new favorite song is drake's song marvin's room, about drake drunk dialing his ex-girlfriend, from a nightclub, to tell her that the guy she's with is a loser, that drake is better, and that she really wants to be with drake. and then points out that his ex is alone at mid-night and answering his phone call, and if her new boyfriend were really so great, she wouldn't be alone. such a juicy song. and i really like cat power.  i like movies, but have never had a tv. i did watch every season of the wire and will agree with terry gross that it's the best tv show ever produced. i can live without a lot, but i appreciate nicely-constructed/well-designed stuff, a good night's sleep and sunshine in the morning. i can live without an iphone... what i'm going to do next. right now i'm spending a lot of time researching/experimenting with plants for a living roof project. rebounding from the work week by getting dinner with a friend or two. or headed out of town. i'm not really a friday night party animal. my parents almost named me corky. and i've ended up with \"squeetzie\" as a nickname. if you want to go to mexico city. or hawaii, lake tahoe, or bolinas. definitely bolinas. or shanghai. i want to go there too.  or if you can direct me to the perfect cowboy poem to read at my sister's upcoming wedding. [update: i read a poem by joel nelson called on finding someone. my sister cried.]\n",
      "i could tell you all about my eye color (blue), or my hair (curly), but i think that's kind of boring. i don't like telling everyone how good or rich i am.  i am versatile - as at home in a tuxedo as in a pair of flip-flops. i like doing all kinds of things, from snowboarding to gallery-hopping. i can be a little hard to pin down sometimes - one of the results of leading a life like mine.  i'm looking for someone that's attractive, laid-back and cool...no pressure, no expectations, let things happen naturally. someone that's striking on the outside, but down to earth on the inside. i've never really wanted something lasting, but now i have a new perspective. but i don't want any typical women, no gold-diggers, flakes, or dum-dums.  so, if you think you've got what it takes, let me know - you might be right. ;) working hard, playing hard, working out, having fun! making people laugh, conversation, dancing...spelling. my size. i love science fiction, but will read any good book. i love a good comedy - archer, always sunny, modern family, bridesmaids. or a good drama - sons of anarchy, hell on wheels, person of interest. why six? anyway...: music books good conversation nature laughter dancing. ways to improve myself and my life. looking for fun! i don't have as many local friends as i would like. you don't mind laughing!\n",
      "my name is margy. i've been living in the bay for over a year now, so i guess i can't really call myself a newb anymore. i love it here, and have been trying not to make my folks back in washington state feel too bad about what they're missing.  i work in intensive care as a nurse. before, i worked as a nurse practitioner in otorhinolaryngology. i'm an ear wax ninja.  most of the stuff i like to do is outside: running, hiking, skiing, climbing, tubing, diving, camping, surfing. i prefer riding my bicycle.  i'm registered for two marathons in the next five months, but i keep injuring myself. please, someone, motivate me.  i love hashing. no thc involved, just running and beer drinking. you should try it.  i like this: \"though subject to his share of depressions, nightmares, and melancholy, he cannot enjoy any of it thoroughly, (and thereby feel his true and tragic worth) because of a nagging doubt that he is very lucky and ought to be thankful and shut up.\" working sometimes, doing everything else instead. i spent three months sailing to mexico last winter with my sweet friend standardhuman. the previous winter, i traveled in central america, and every february i do volunteer medical work in haiti. this summer, i'd like to spend days at a stretch backpacking in the sierra and yosemite. hot springs are a favorite destination of mine.  i always have a number of projects going on: painting things, pimping out my bicycle, getting creative in the kitchen. staring at the ground looking for interesting rocks. i'd like to spend more time climbing and playing frisbee sports - two things i love and sort of suck at. enjoying whatever life has to offer. it's quite rare that i feel angry or sad. discussing the state of the world/our broken healthcare system can get me riled up, though.  i'm brewing beer in my closet.  i'm a solid scrabble teammate (or a worthy opponent), and not too shabby in the words with friends department, either. if you want a game, find me! (margysaur) also can't get enough of cribbage. it's the best two person game out there.  putting time and love into the creation of food.  perseverance as a rule. i don't like giving up on things or people that i'm committed to.  planning last minute adventures. big smile and distinctive laugh. and i talk a lot. i only wear knee socks. i'm really good at reading the first half of a lot of books (damn add). authors i love: salman rushdie, malcolm gladwell, bill bryson, pearl s. buck, rohinton mistry, vonnegut, steinbeck.  the music i like is expansive. girl singers, hip hop, led zeppelin, bluegrass, loud and fast. bands with lots of instruments and lots of energy. anything i can dance to or sing along with. i don't have a problem with music snobs, but i really can't hang in conversation centered on the latest underground stuff that only a few supercool people have ever heard of.  i'm somewhere between vegetarian and vegan, but entirely avoid imposing my opinions on others. i love food. also on the list, good beer and cheap whiskey.  i haven't had an actual tv for years, but let's be honest... computers are the new tv. i'll get as hooked on crack as the next girl. if you know what i mean. 1. adventures and activity 2. things that give me goosebumps 3. some iteration of a kitchen 4. ethiopian food and soy products 5. music and npr 6. rocks where i want to go next. also, saving the world. cooking an ambitious dinner- beer in one hand, wooden spoon in the other. having people over or fixin' to go out.  alternatively, shopping/packing for a wilderness adventure.  the beauty of nursing is that i work no more than 3 days a week, so my life has more than the standard allotment of saturdays. my mom loves me best. you like playing games (card, not mind), and you have trouble finding people to play with.  you dig chicks with scars.  you're kinky and uninhibited. i'm really not on here to find someone to make babies with and love forever and ever. that being said, sex is soooo much better when the involved parties connect in ways beyond just having body parts that fit together.\n",
      "hi, my name's gabe. i have one of the zaniest senses of humor of anyone i know. i either tend to leave people slack-jawed in shock or giggling uncontrollably ie during a quiz game i accused a friend of cheating for using his brain, i excused myself from the group & after i'd returned, i denied that i had & accused someone else.  i'm an arm-chair: comedian, philosopher, politician, domestic human rights activist. i'm also a sometimes rock & jazz musician, computer-tinkerer & all around deep thinker. my friends know me to be witty, knowledgeable, down-to-earth, kooky, kind & trustworthy.  i've been playing guitar for over a decade & like to think i'm pretty good. i studied music theory & jazz improv in my more serious college days, noodle around a lot on my guitar & occasionally come up with my own stuff. i also sing & program the occasional synthesizer & have taken electronic music & recording classes at ccsf.  i'm an enormous movie buff & have seen a ridiculous number of films. i particularly love sci-fi, fantasy, high-flying kung fu films & the occasional horror film, but also like comedies or really any good movie.  music-wise i like rock, metal, 80's pop, some funk, jazz or jazz fusion & electronic music. i take the occasional class at ccsf. i'm currently taking a jazz improv class at the moment to keep my guitar skills fresh and have been dabbling at computer programming. but i have a disability that makes it difficult for me to work, so i'm not currently working or seriously studying. it's not the kind of disability you can obviously see such as muscular dystrophy, and doesn't effect my mental capacity. it only impairs my ability to handle stress. it's a bit personal though, so i don't tend to talk about it much. if you'd really like to know the specifics i'd be happy to tell you once we get to know each other better. telling stories, kooky humor, being a human encyclopedia, playing guitar(?) my height, my smile, my personableness most decent fantasy/sci-fi/horror books and films (i've read nearly the entire dark elf series and watched all the x-men and underworld films) though i tend to have a soft spot for books and films that have a philosophical edge, not all of them fantasy/sci-fi (books: ender's game, stranger in a strange land, movies: the shawshank redemption, the last emperor).  music...classic rush, some pink floyd, some 80's hair metal like wasp, classic iron maiden, a few 90's bands like stone temple pilots and alice in chains, pagan's mind, opeth, chiptunes (cheery!), some 70's & 80's pop/ballads, a little of this and that (with coupon, free to mix and match)  food: japanese & italian good friends good food love & affection comfort fun humor what i can do to make the most of my life. hanging out with friends, chilling at home i accidentally called my teacher \"fat\" in front of the whole class in 3rd grade. no really! it was an accident, i swear! i really wanted to say something funny but was afraid of saying the wrong thing... i wound up obsessing over it and when it finally came out it came out all wrong... she actually took it quite well all things considered... but man, i never felt so ashamed.. :-/ you're a sweet & nurturing person. you're the kind of person that takes pleasure in the pleasure of others. you're kind and compassionate. you're physically affectionate. you're down to earth and can enjoy a night at home as well as a night on the town. you're fun-loving and don't take yourself too seriously. you're not particularly judgmental and open minded. you've got big boobs. ;-p\n",
      "hey, my name's chad, i'm 21, and i go to sfsu. i used to live about a half hour south of la, in a real small town called san pedro. i play a couple instruments, but i'm majoring in technical writing. i'm thinking about going for a master's degree, so i might be going to be at sfsu for a while, but i've been really enjoying it so far, so no complaints.  i finished a huge internship over the summer and just got a job, and i'm hoping to graduate in may. i love the show archer and the author jon irving. honestly, even if i write a few pages' worth of information here, i doubt i could actually give you a good idea of who i am.  all the writing i do is technical, like manuals & stuff, so having to think and write creatively about myself is turning out to be harder than i thought it would. if you're ever looking for an instructional manual or tech specifications guide, i'm your guy.  also, okcupid seems to think i'm some bigtime lazy stoner. i'm totally not. i've smoked some pot, and i'm definitely 4/20 friendly, but i'm not exactly bob marley. i go to sfsu with a major in technical writing. i just got a job, and i'm doing literally everything i can to make money. currently i spend my life going to school, listening to music, watching netflix, or cooking. i don't like cooking, but i do like eating, so cooking is sort of a necessary evil. apathy. damn am i good at apathy. probably my dashing good looks and unrelenting machismo. either that, or a strong, self-deprecating sense of sarcasm... i'm really into john irving and i've read a lot of anne rice. lately i've been reading stuff by richard dawkins, but he gets really intense, and as such he's not a lot of fun to read. barbara kingsolver is pretty amazing. i'm reading the \"his dark materials\" series by phillip pullman these days.  i love going to the movies but i don't really thing i have 'favorites'. i really liked zombieland, hot fuzz is a good one, and scott pilgrim vs. the world was pretty great.  my taste in music is stupid. i'm really in to metal, but nothing super intense. i think the sound track to the game \"brutal legends\" was pretty much perfect, if that's any indicator. along with the love for metal though, i'm really, really into classical. i've got a solid 9 gigs of ludwig van on my ipod. one of my friends just showed me flogging molly a few months ago! shit they're a great band! these last couple of months have been spent obsessing over flogging molly.  specifically, for music? amanda palmer, apocalyptica, the beatles, beethoven, black sabbath, blink 182, bob dylan, cold war kids, coldplay, david bowie, detektivbyran, the dresden dolls, flogging molly (!!), gorilla thrilla, green day, jason webley, the killers, kow otani, leningrad, metallica, modest mouse, modest mussorgsky, the mountain goats, muse (i love muse), nirvana, the orcarina of time soundtrack, oingo boingo, queen, r.e.m., radiohead, camille saint-saens, the seatbelts, serj tankian, smashing pumpkins, the strokes, system of a down, team teamwork, tom petty (& the heartbreakers), violent femmes, weezer, and the who. and others.  as for food, i honestly think i'm one of those people who are \"up for anything\". i guess i can be kind of picky, but i can find something to eat at really any restaurant. good mexican food is a favorite, but i think well-made italian is the best. hell, i can even go for bad mexican; taco bell is amazing when you only have $4.  i used to watch a lot of television, but not as much any more. i follow house and the office. house is a total soap opera now, but whatever. i really love the show archer, it's hilarious, and arrested development's a blast. i'm half-way through season 3 of battlestar galactica. watching battlestar galactica is probably the nerdiest thing i do. six things i could never do without... i guess my computer, my phone, coffee, friends or family (one or the other), sleep, and music. not in that order, though. school, work, schoolwork, money, music, how shitty tv is.. i don't know. i daydream a lot. usually on a typical friday night i'm sitting around with my roommates, doing homework or talking about stupid shit like whether or not louis c.k. is as honest as he seems, or where mitch hedberg would be if he didn't die. i don't know if i have anything private to admit. i don't know, i really want to learn the accordion? if you have a private question just ask and i'll probably give you a straight answer.  my opinions on super heroes are almost as strong as my political opinions. and my political opinions are really goddamn strong. you should message me if you are also bored, and at or near sfsu.  honestly, even if you don't want to do the dating scene, at this point i'm down to just hang out, see a movie or just walk around and explore san francisco.\n",
      "what i'm looking for: anyone who like girls ages 26-55 near me - oakland who are single for long-term dating  also i'm severely allergic to cats, so if you have one or 5, you shouldn't email me.  i am looking for a primary partner who i will be a priority to. i like to play but i want to play together (with my primary) with others. please consider this before emailing me.  ok, i'll start out with the fact that i'm a 100% italian, jersey girl. i'm a first generation italian american who grew up in nj right outside manhattan. once you know me better, you'll see how this manifests. i drove cross country in '95 and have lived all over the bay area ever since. currently i'm in oakland.  i am a bigger girl...it is who i am. i've been a big girl since birth practically and i now love it. i feel sexier then ever, i feel more confident then ever, i feel more alive then ever. i would really love someone to share that with.  i love to love. i need someone who is willing to be loved and is willing to give me love. i like to hold hands and kiss in public, i like to be happy. there is a caveat....i'm not interested in a suffocating kind of love....i prefer a mutually appreciating love that respects the fact that each of us has our own lives to live. we love each other because we love each other...not because we own each other. yah know what i mean??  i communicate very well, am honest to a fault most of the time. i let people know what i need and i like to surround myself with people who do the same. i am not a mind reader and i don't expect anyone else to be.  i go to the movies often, love holding hands in that big dark room.  i also love my alone time and will respect the fact that you need yours. also, i have a love/hate relationship with my cell phone. i know that i have to have one, but that just makes it so easy for people to call/txt me. truth be told...i won't always reply. i just don't like to be that accessible.  i love to play with willing partners, i like going to swing parties but that does not mean i'm easy, there has to be something between us for me to get excited about being with you. i love finding someone i have a spark with i could just drown in that feeling and appreciate it for what it is. i like finding like minded individuals that share my feelings about life and love.  all that being said, there is the huge contradictory part of me. there is a truly feminine part of me that wants to be treated like a princess by my night in shining armor. attending hai workshops and belonging to the hai community has become part of my life. if you know what a hai is or have ever attended a workshop, you get bonus points.  i went to europe for the first time ever, in sept 2009! spent 17 days in london, paris, rome, florence and san giorgio a liri, the latter of which is my dad's home town. he died in 2006. it was literally a dream trip come true. need to travel more!!!  travel update: went to amsterdam in 5/11... had a wonderful time with people i met there and my sister who i went with!! 100%honesty 100% of the time, communication, cooking, making my partner feel good, making myself look cute... i love playing with hair and makeup.  i'm pretty good at crocheting, cooking, sewing, arts and crafts, oh and shopping for shoes and lingerie. being spooned, and spooning, cuddling and rolling around in bed in general. i love, love, love taking long baths, with lots of bath salts and nice girly, sweet smells and magic potions. my tattoos, my eyes, my smile. and, oh yeah my boobs.  i have large breasts, whether you consider it good or bad, it is a fact that they get noticed. moonstruck is probably my favorite guilty pleasure movie. i'll name a few of my favorites here: the fighter fight club the godfather garden state goodfellas singin' in the rain some like it hot 12 monkeys the 5th element pulp fiction happy gilmore 40 year old virgin young frankenstein willy wonka and the chocolate factory (the original)  i like independent films, i'm slightly annoyed with hollywood right now. but, i like fluffy comedies and romantic comedies too. i know thats a contradiction, but so be it. hehe  as far as books, i enjoy reading self help books that fit my life style. a long time ago i read a book called 'learning to say no, developing healthy boundries'... my favorite recent one is 'the ethical slut' for fiction, i like to read fun romance and pulp. healthy communication sex cuddling a good sharp chef's knife italian food close friends adventure travel connecting with others  ok so i went over 6, so sue me...hehe how to really be the person i really want to be. how to live in the moment, and appreciate what i have. where to travel to next. boys boys boys....i love them with friends, at a show. maybe in my bath tub, or just laying in bed watching a movie or reading. wink wink, nudge nudge ; ) you like what you've read and you aren't afraid of a large size girl. i'm a size 18. i am extremely confident and feel sexy most of the time.  you like a girl who can be a little loony sometimes, spontaneous and very down to earth all at the same time.  i should also say here, that i am severely allergic to cats. so if you live with cats, it's probably not a good idea to message me.  also if you don't have any pictures on your profile, i most likely won't reply... just trying to be honest!!\n",
      "this awesome dude (according to friends and family) loves indie rock, nutella ice cream, playing guitar badly and cooking awesome pasta and steak. he's one of the crazy ones, a trouble maker, trying to find beauty in this breathtaking city. i make computers play nicely with people. not at easy job since they only speak in 011100100110111101100010011011110111010000100001 (as you can guess by now, i'm a dork) doing things with- ing cooking, rocking, eating, drinking, thinking, meeting new people and discovering new places.

[...] when you are sharing your body and heart with a great woman the world fades away. you two are the only ones in the entire universe. you conquer what most lesser men have never conquered before, you have conquered a great woman's heart, the most vulnerable thing she can offer to another. death no longer lingers in the mind. i am a foodie, a vinyl records collector, and a whiskey lover. so i'm either on a rock concert, a new restaurant or making new friends while holding a scotch in my hand. cloudy with a chance of meatballs, mallrats and phineas and ferb are the most awesome things in this planet. (yup, my dorkiness strikes back). you are someone who would like to discover the small hidden palaces in the city, those places that are hidden from everyone except for those who dares to go out and explore.\n",

      "ok, i will give a sketch of my life. i've earned my life stripes by living as close to my heart and live in integrity. i believe we are here to improve not only our own life, but to help make the world a better place to live for all. i have had many occupations and this has opened many doors and given me many ways to see why we live in a multi-colored world full of creativity and wisdom. it is for these reasons i enjoy living fully absorbing as much i can in each arena. listening to the inner voices, making movies in my creative eye, seeing the unseen, following a recipe, speaking calmly, loving gently, opening hidden doors, sharing tantra, practicing good health, and saying what needs to be heard. i've been told what people notice about me are a calm demeanor, kindness, creativity, earnestness to live fully, and my taoist humor. people seem to think i'm younger than my chronological age, which i attribute to my mother's genes. other things seem to be subjective depending on the moment, if you get the drift. my library is full of metaphysical, healing, art, spiritual, psychological, art books. movies range from martial arts to cross cultural to romantic adventures. oh, food wise i am pretty eclectic and open to most diverse appetites. nature, thunderstorms, oceans, night skies, sunrise & sunsets, cosmic love. how to help my clients and be of good service to all. i could be at home working on my book, cooking, kicking back watching a dvd, spending an evening out with friends, or meditating. i've walked the cable of the golden gate bridge tower to tower. and on named bridge helped to prevent a person from committing suicide. ...you care to see how our energies match, checking out to see if our core values resonate, e.g., staying health conscious and working out, meditate, on your spiritual path, are a compassionate soul, respond to tantric practices, transparent, and allow for spontaneity and adventure.\n",

      "i was born in fort wayne, indiana, near the ohio border where my parents lived. some 28 years after this momentous event, i somehow ended up in california, where i am working on my ph.d at stanford university. i work hard during the day, waste time on teh intrawebs, hang out with friends, go to the gym. i am also trying to kill both my eyes and ears by reading too many books and listening to too much music.  my philosophy is never to take anything too seriously. emphasis on the \"too\": i do take many, many things seriously, such as my work, my studies, relationships etc. but there needs to be some perspective in these things, as in most everything in this grand comedy we call \"life.\"  i love jokes, whether good or bad. i laugh alot, and often chuckle at the littlest things. it is hard to describe myself personality-wise, since i have never met myself. i suspect we would get along fine and knock a couple of cold ones on the porch. but i will say this: i am always trying to improve myself.  i will probably either die of diet coke induced brain rot, or when one of my bookshelves falls on top of me. either way, i will go down smiling. there will be an irish wake at my funeral, even though i am not irish, and the pogues will play in the background. i am a sixth (and final!) year phd. student in classics (the study of greek and latin) at stanford. i am currently writing my dissertation on archaic greek literature.  and yes, i do actually get paid to do this, which is both awesome and kinda ridiculous, since my \"dissertation research\" as of late has more involved watching multiple episodes of the wire than actually writing the dissertation.  naturally, i hope to get a sweet tenure-track job as a professor at an university.  photography as of late has become a passion of mine. i shoot with the iphone primarily, but you will often see me dragging my newly dslr camera to events and shoving it in people's faces. instagram, flickr, 500px are quickly becoming my favorite apps / websites. ...being awesome. i have a knack for finding awesome humorous t-shirts. wait, there is only one box for all this stuff? oh well- here it goes:  books / authors:  the iliad by homer; pindar; theocritus; orlando furioso by ariosto; egil's saga; demons and brothers k by dostoevsky; kokoro by natsume soseki; cloud atlas by david mitchell; hamlet, king lear, the tempest etc. by shakespeare; the golden compass and the amber spyglass by philip pullman frank miller's batman: the dark knight returns; watchmen  music: the rolling stones, basement jaxx, bob dylan, m.i.a.,beyonce, spoon, feist, opeth, jay-z, the dirty projectors, stars, sleater kinney, robyn, tom waits. and despite my social milieu, i honestly and unironically like some country.  movies: high fidelity; the usual assortment of coen brothers and quentin tarantino movies (fargo, big lebowski, pulp fiction); raiders of the lost ark; the good, the bad, and the ugly; ghost in the shell. and i pretty much know the christmas story by heart, and will quote it extensively.  tv: the wire; full metal alchemist; buffy the vampire slayer; arrested development; british comedies (fawlty towers, keeping up appearances); twin peaks. i am catching up on breaking bad right now.  and pizza is undeniably the most superior foodstuff invented by man. 1.) food and water. well duh.  2.) eye glasses, because that whole bookshelf next to me ain't going to read itself.  3.) coffee- how else am i going to answer my e-mails and read the new york times in the morning?  4.)trader joe's cats cookies- i am addicted to these things. what other food item can be substituted for any meal of the day, and remain delicious and relatively low calorie at the same time?  5.) the internet. what did people do without it? 6.) spell-checking. because i have too much i need to know already in two dead languages without having to remember how to spell something in english. sheesh. ...how to convert homer into an anime television series. seriously. this is my favorite daydream at the gym. ...with my friends, whether just hanging out or having semi-inebriated wacky hijinks. i have become that person. you know that person that has several ipods, an iphone, an ipad, and imac desktop? i have become that asshole. sorry! ...you love books. trust me on this one, we will have alot to talk about.  ...you like snarky commentary and bad movies...  ...you want to hear some bad puns. hey, if they are good enough for shakespeare, they are good enough for me.\n",
      "i grew up just outside of boston (yay red sox fans) and went to college in new york (boo yankees fans) and moved out to the bay area for grad school about a year and a half ago. i ended up loving it here and decided to stick around!  if i had to describe myself in one sentence, i'd say i am an outgoing guy, who loves the outdoors, music, good conversation, and a good story. if i were to say a little more, i'd say i really enjoy hanging out with my friends and those that i love, and prefer to share good times with others. i've been told i'm pretty funny, and i love to tell stories, have a soft spot for puns, and take a lot of pleasure in making people laugh. i'm very easy going, and pride myself in always trying to have a smile on my face and my head up.  environmental and social causes are really important to me, and i'm very dedicated to helping those less fortunate in this world. i've helped tutor or teach kids in various subject for years, and recently taught intro to photography classes to middle schooler from economically disadvantaged communities in the bay area. it was an amazing experience to be able to open a child's life to a new form of expression and help grow their confidence that their ideas are worth listening to.  i really value kindness, sense of humor, and spontaneity and i'm looking for a cool girl to hang out and have fun with. honestly, though, i'm really much more interested in what you have to say about yourself, so if you like what you see shoot me a message! i recently wrapped up a masters in sustainable design & construction at stanford and just moved up to sf in january. i have a dream job working at a green building design firm in oakland and could not be happier with it!  i go crazy if i don't have some sort of physical exercise in my weekly routine. over the past year i took up rock climbing more seriously, which has been a ton of fun, and will never turn down a chance to kayak (whitewater or sea kayaking).  my friends and family surprised me a year ago by all pitching in to get me a really nice camera, now i can't imagine my life without it. i'm not a gifted drawer by any means, so it's been cool to have an artistic outlet. if you are at all interested feel free to check out my flickr page.  http://www.flickr.com/photos/noahzallen/sets questions like this make me a bit uncomfortable, since i don't like sounding as if i'm tooting my own horn. that being said, some things i think i'm pretty decent at are: photography, rock climbing, kayaking, working with my hands, math, baseball, story telling, making appetizers with cheese, improvising, bananagrams, and making people smile. i've never actually asked anyone, but if i had to venture a guess: i'm a bit tall, smile a lot, and i'm pretty enthusiastic. music is a big part of my life. i love live performances and rocking out to music with friends. i'll groove to anything from funk to folk or grunge to mashup dance music, and i love finding new artists. some of my favorite bands right now are company of thieves, the avett brothers, counting crows, and the white stripes  i'm a super unpicky eater and like nearly all kinds of cuisine. i also a huge fan of farmers markets and fresh produce, and i'll always take home cooked food over high end cuisine.  as for books, some of my favorites i've read recently are the amazing adventures of cavalier & clay and the brief wondrous life of oscar wao.  my favorite tv shows currently are community, archer, and 30 rock.  some of my favorite movies i've seen recently are assasination of a high school president, the sting, and the shawshank redemption nature (particularly mountains and oceans) live music friends & family funny stories my camera fresh produce beyond the usual (the future, romance, etc), i do spend a fair amount of time thinking about what i'm going to eat next and how i can get myself to south america hanging out with friends sharing a drink or two after a long work week, out dancing, or heading out on a camping trip for the weekend. i actually still really enjoy collecting rocks and shells at the beach... you like what you see and wanna get to know me better than a few short blurbs.\n",
      "the ever so fun part about online dating...talking about yourself =(. i think of myself as mature and the go getter type. i have two roommates, a full time job and go to school at night. so with that being said i don't have much time to waste, but can always make time for the right person. in my spare time i enjoy martial arts practice, movies, going to the beach on a warm day and camping. i'm the romantic type with a realist twist. there is nothing more endearing than having that special someone to buy flowers for and see her smile. i'm working towards my a.a in admin of justice. i'm probably going to start the police academy in six month to a year. i want to join the police department. in high school i was a fire explorer and have always enjoyed public service. planning awesome day trips and having an intelligent conversation. i also like to think that i'm good at being affectionate. i'm better talking over the phone than texting. i just think that texting is in-personable. i'm honest and upfront. i tend to speak whats on my mind. i really do believe that honesty and communication are the skeleton to building a lasting and happy friend/relationship. i love spicy food and tend to eat mostly everything. i enjoy ethnic food. i like beer but i think that all guys do lol. music, i listen to everything from alternative or fairly new and mix it up with some 90's rock. movies i really liked 500 days of summer, it's kind of a funny story, about a boy and breach. sleep exercise friendship a job sense of humor where i will be at in five years. if i'm ever going to meet the one lol. normally homework, sometimes catch up with my friends or gearing up for my next big hike/adventure. some chick flicks are awesome and i listen to john mayer. if your not glued to your cell or facebook account. if you actually have intentions of meeting in person.\n",

      "i am a happy, confident, loving, smart, compassionate woman looking to share deep friendship, sensual play, spiritual and physical exploration, and fun adventures. i am open hearted and passionate about life, a fantastic listener and kisser, loyal and honest, and deeply turned on by anything that affirms the beauty and magic of life on earth. i feel at home surrounded by miles of wilderness, and i can have a city edge too. i work in the financial district and i love the click of high healed shoes on wet pavement (though i usually am not the one wearing them.) i am a romantic, but also a goal setter. in other words, i am multifaceted; i will probably surprise you at some point. and i hope that you'll surprise me too.  right now i am interested in meeting like minded men that hope to, one day soon, form an intimate partnership that leads to stepping into the adventure of creating a home together and having a child. loving my work which is building the capacity of environmental groups in china to protect water resources. i am also slowly learning to sing and meditate. quieting my mind and listening to my soul. practicing the joy of staying in the moment. whitewater rafting, editing, and making my tongue into a flower. people usually notice that i am tall and have expressive eyes. later, they often notice i am the kind of person you want around when the shit hits the fan. i savor james, dostoevsky, hemingway...recently read and enjoyed anna karenina, just kids by patti smith, and the heart is a lonely hunter by carson mccullers. classic film noir and foreign or avant-gard films (e.g. hitchcock, kusturica, zhang yimou). i love reading poetry or plays with friends on rainy nights by a warm fire. just re-read captain's verses by pablo neruda - yum!  i love almost all asian food and i enjoy a variety of healthy foods. i indulge now and then. my weakness is ice cream. i don't eat meat, for ethical reasons, but i think of this as a personal choice rather than something to debate at length. i like to cook. i garden a bit, and want to do more.  i enjoy a variety of music, from classical to punk; i am often more into complicated or very soulful music. a few artists i am currently enjoying: alela diane, dusty springfield, el camaron de la isla, zoe keating, pentangle. i am an amateur musician (cello, some guitar, ukulele, and singing) and playing music with friends is one of my favorite things to do. my most recent musical adventure is playing cello at an irish traditional jam in berkeley.  interests-wise, i have to mention the great outdoors: rafting, surfing (i suck, but love), swimming, hiking, bouldering, skiing, mushroom hunting. i also have to mention the great indoors (e.g. the inner landscape and the infinite exploration possible through): meditation, native american church, yoga, ecstatic dance, tantra.  yet i am not interested in meeting someone who carbon copy style likes all the same things i like; i mean compatibility is good, but what can you introduce me to? love, laughter, self-respect, jumping into water, clean air, the shade of trees creating balance in my life. playing music, making food, going to listen to live music somewhere, having a cocktail or two, heading for the mountains, going dancing, going to a yoga class, watching a movie...all these are strong possibilities but i am not much of a \"routine\" person. i can be very gullible. you have volunteered for a good cause and enjoyed it. you are open to long-term commitment to some level. you are open to having kids some day.\n",

(besides, do you really care where i grew up? it's new jersey... not from the shore.) nevertheless, i promise it's interesting and involves multiple states, lots of music, multiple degrees, epic stories, some political campaign, but nothing illegal.  in other news, i love my family, friends and fun. i work hard but i know when to take a break. i like to take lots of breaks. anyway, email me if you want to know more. i started a new job at a biotech company after finishing a dual masters in public health and public policy. i also have a low-key and awesome piano gig going at a local coffee shop. love them both. remembering useless trivia powerpoint (yep, i just wrote that and i love it) writing songs (when the mood strikes) i'm told that i have a great laugh. supposedly, it's a very 'happy' laugh. books: i love non-fiction, the three musketeers & gone with the wind excepted. movies: re-watching movies that make me laugh is a favorite past time, including: thank you for smoking and forgetting sarah marshall. tv: the west wing, friends & how i met your mother. music: everything. really. food: only the good stuff. i'm not a vegan or vegetarian, but i like to keep it healthy. 1. family 2. friends 3. my piano 4. a running trail outside 5. the newspaper/news 6. a view of the water 1. health care. why are health prices so high while quality and outcomes remain so varied? why are patients forced to pay for services and tests based on cost rather than on value?  2. politics / policy. why is there such a lack of transparency in government? how can we engage the public to make more informed decisions? when is it appropriate for citizens to overturn legislative or judicial rulings? why is there so much hidden money in government, and does that really effect outcomes?  3. what i am going to eat for dinner. i love to cook and don't like making the same dish twice if i can help it -- unless it's amazing. out, hopefully! last weekend was dinner + a comedy club with friends. i'm still a little concerned about this whole internet privacy thing, so i'll save this answer for later... you can reach things on the top shelf.\n",

(um, not that i'm judging you guys.) - my next meal. - your beautiful eyes. - how i can best support the progressive causes that matter most to me. - whether i'll still exist after i die. - whether i put the right amount of product in my hair. - that last one was a joke. i always use exactly the right amount. making it rain!  just kidding. i'd probably screw it up if i tried. i can barely handle shuffling a deck of cards. i wonder if i should lie about my height since everyone else on this site apparently does it: http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-biggest-lies-in-online-dating/  also, this article is about me: http://jezebel.com/5902718/creepy-finance-guy-with-spreadsheet-of-matchcom-prospects-says-he-was-just-trying-to-be-organized you're comfortable with the possibility that this might happen if the first date doesn't go well: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2071127/bankers-1-615-word-email-woman-didnt-back.html  but seriously: message me if you're active, smart, and passionate about what you're doing with your life. i'm pretty sure there's a lot more to life than being really, really, ridiculously good looking. and i plan on finding out what that is.\n",

      "hey honkies. you folks wanna buy some heroin? goddamnit, i'm serious.  enough about me. if you like: food, wine, intelligent conversation tempered by dumb practical jokes, dressing up, dressing down, being gorgeous, curves, heels, pumps, travel, adventure, motorcycles, small planes, challenges, insight, laughing, have passion & most of all talent... we'll get along great.  if we inspire each other i'd love to teach each other cool stuff!  take a hit out of the little brown bottle in my shaving kit. you won't need much, just a tiny taste. a spontaneous trip to california where a two month \"let's get our pilot's licence\" stint with a friend turned into a year and a commercial qualification.  back to my nerdy but fun day job! honestly? yeah, that.  stories: plenty of bizarre situations with excellent characters from red-neck black widows to the 6'6\" white leather texan to...  intuition: and using it for the power of good.  spontaneity: having a motorcycle (triumph speed triple) and pilot's license helps. brace for the g's, and fast heel-toe work. i'd rather not say. my brother's in politics. my kindle rocks because it's a kindle and is now full of really fascinating shit, that i can read all at once. hmm, i don't really do the \"high fidelity top 5\" thing.  $100 says i can eat faster than you! and i will make more mess. but you might just go apeshit and start flinging stuff around... yeah, ok, that'd be worth seeing even if you won.  i &heart; music. what kind of rat bastard psychotic would play that song right now, at this moment?

(finally, if you're great i don't judge on age; one of the most charming & smart people i met here was 19 at the time.  oh, lucy. i met her on the plane. yeah, she's a religious freak. i gave her a cap before i realized... jesus, she's never even had a drink before.)\n",

      "hello all! my name is shallen and i'm a woman who looks at the glass of life half full. even during the rough patches of life i still feel that i'm very blessed and i'm thankful for all i have. i am a spiritual person that loves the lord and would not be the woman i am today without his love and grace. i'm a down to earth romantic, whose goofy, and funny but has a lot of common sense. i'm a positive thinker and i love to smile. i enjoy the simple pleasures of life but i'm also always up for an adventure. i enjoy working out and am loving the results of healthy living. i am a big fan of taking fun pictures and being in them so 9 times out of 10 i will always have a camera on me...its my thing. i've been called the social butterfly of my friends and i own that title proudly. i'm full of energy 90% of the time and love that i can inspire my loved ones to live to their fullest potential! :) so the real question is what am i not doing with my life? i say this, to say, that i'm a productive gal. i like to stay that way because it makes me feel good and everything i'm doing has a purpose and is geared towards my future goals. this is not to say that i don't have time for family, friends, myself and others. i work full time as a logistics specialist (fancy name for office manager) and in my free time volunteer at an organization that provides grief counseling for kids and families. i'm also a full time grad student (i started about a month ago). i have my bachelors of science degree in business management and i'm currently going to school to get my masters in counseling psychology and i love it. my ultimate dream is to work with the population of youth that are forgotten. i hope to one day create programs and be a part of a movement to motivate, uplift, mentor and empower the urban youth of the bay area to their greatest potential. within the juvenile probation centers/programs there is a huge need for what i'd like to do. those children are our future and this is my true passion. i know i was put here to do this type of work and god willing i will see it through and this will be my legacy i leave on the planet. i'm really good at being a loyal friend. seeing the best in things and people. being a goof ball. being happy! being weird, quirky and unique in the best possible ways. lol! i think that life is too short to be anything but who you came here to be and that is what i intend to always dobe true to who i am. i'm that person that will lift you up when you're down, i'll keep you positive and smiling. my nickname is sunshine and it fits. i'm that light that will shine on you and make you remember why you're truly blessed. lastly, i'm really good at working hard and playing hard. it's all about balance baby!! :) my smile. next i get asked if i'm always this positive and why. it's kind of a crazy question, to me, because my response is usually why not!? then people notice how funny i am and that i'm really a genuine soul that just likes to laugh and have a great time. food: i love all foods...except peas! if i had to pick a favorite meal i'd say philly cheese steaks (from the philly cheese steak shop in berkeley) with mushrooms, grilled onions, extra sweet peppers, and cheese. if i had to pick my favorite type of food i'd say mexican food! love everything about it! cheese is my weakness and i'm a dip and sause girl so load all that on, extra is good too! :)  tv shows: i'm a reality tv show junkie and i'm not ashamed to admit it either! i also like old school martin re-runs, dateline, csi, law & order svu, happy endings, necessary roughness, 20/20, suits, modern family, revenge and glee! i love a lot of tv shows but don't get to watch as many as i'd like.  books: motivational/ inspirational/self-help books, astrology, and school text books for my counseling psy. program  movies: i love scary movies!!! i'm not really sure why but i just know that i like that feeling of anticipation of what's coming nexti like that nervous feeling when you're in the movie theater and you jump in your seat. oh and yes i sometimes scream! some of my other favorite movies are bad boys (only the first one), the best man, bettlejuice, love jones, little shop of horrors, thin line between love & hate, original sin, serial mom  music: i'm a neo-soul head love love love neo-soul with all my heart. i'm also a fan of r & b, hip hop, smooth jazz, rap, alternative, a little rock and mediation music. the lord food common sense family/friends a good night's rest or nap music there are so many other things but these are the top 6! i spend a lot of time thinking about so many things that its hard to turn my brain off sometimes. but if i had to pick 1 or 2 top things it would be my future, personally and professionally. i'm a romantic at heart so i'm hopeful for that happy ending with a loving husband, fun marriage and amazing kids one day too. on friday night you could find me doing a lot of different things depending where the wind blows. i could be relaxing in my bed from a long week, going hard in the gym because no one is there so the hot tub, steam room and sauna are all mine, or stepping out with my friends grabbing a drink and getting my two step on, or lastly studying and trying to knock out my homework so i'll have my weekend free. the most private thing i'm willing to admit is that i'm 32 and i have never seen real snow fall from of the sky! :( i've seen dirty snow in harlem on the ground but never real snow flakes falling from the heavens! i know i know...it's quite embarrassing at this point in my life! lol! i make plans every year to do it and it has yet to pan out in my favor! hopefully this is the year! lol :) you should message me if you feel we are like-minded. i am interested in a man that loves the lord and who is spiritual in his own way. he is a classy gentleman, that loves and respects himself and his mother, first and foremost. he is a compassionate, charming, daring, intelligent, full of passion, humorous, affectionate, strong (mentally and physically) kinda of guy. he is productive, has a full life, friends and is happy not because of anything material but genuinely happy, just because. i'm looking for someone that is secure in his confidence (not stuck up or egotistical) but humbled by his insecurities. he will be conscious and proactive about his health and enjoy taking care of his appearance. he's strong in what he believes in, can fight fair and always communicates his needs and wants respectfully. i believe that anything is possible including this amazing man. i'm looking forward to meeting him soon. if you feel you exemplify these qualities and want to meet a unique woman give me a jingle!\n",

      "i am deeply committed to a path of consciousness, having had many experiences in my life that enrich and guide who i am as a man and as a person. i initiate and create memorable learning experiences for others and have a strong tendency toward leadership in the venues in which i operate. i am more jungian in my orientation than any other particular lens of looking at self, others, and life. i am a seeker of understanding all and everything. buddhism sings to me although i am not a practicing buddhist.  i have two wonderful children, aged 8 and 19 from my previous marriage. my ex and i are very good friends and work extremely well together in our co-parenting.  the capacity to hold both openness to discovering all that is available in life, and to act in integrity are important tensions that guide my life, and something i seek in others. i am, above all, a truth teller and a truth seeker. i am very emotionally available, but not always. sometimes i retreat into myself, and then come back easily. i am not perfect by any means, but seek to be fluid in myself and with another. i have a strong capacity for compassion. in the little prince, the fox said: \"it is only with the heart that one can see rightly. what is most essential is invisible to the eye.\" i share that perspective and seek to live it actively.  i seek a woman who is strongly grounded in herself, is wise and heartfelt. i welcome rich exploration of the unconscious. deep connection matters a lot to me. what we do together matters less that how we do it. i seek a soulful life, rich with exploration and mystery. i like women with strong inner character who know who they are and what they want. i also love a strong dose of the feminine. these two extremes are not easy to come by, and yet i welcome them. looks matter to me, but not too much. inner beauty matters much more.  i believe that a committed relationship is a powerful crucible for transformation when both parties enter into it with a strong desire for growth, learning, and inner discovery.  i am not so much interested in what you do for a living or what you like to do in your spare time. i love to go to tropical places too, and take walks in the rain as much as anyone. what i am deeply interested in knowing, however, is whether you are a woman with a strength of character, able to enter into a soulful, deep, and completely self-honest relationship with another. i find myself attracted to a woman who is willing to tell me she is upset with me, and to simultaneously own that her upset is a reflection of herself. while she does that, i open myself to facing that i have done something to trigger the upset and there is great learning there for me. do you have the ego strength to join me in being curious about how we are both attached to a point of view, and that our attachment intermingles with one another such that we are in a pattern, the cause of which is both our own \"stuff\" and even perhaps forces that have shaped couples from time memoriam, and that we are simply playing out a stream that we had no choice in the matter? and can you join me in dancing between those two possibilities, knowing that we can never know fully which is true? i'd like to meet a woman who cares less about entering a cave in kauai, hi and more about entering the mystery. and, by the way, these are the same qualities i seek in all my friends, both men and women alike.  i am creative, inquisitive, and soulful i write books, consulting to organizations, lead a consulting firm, and give talks on the subject of remarkable leadership. i also attend workshops, lead workshops, learn, grow, and explore. writing, thinking, exploring, creating, facilitating breakthroughs in people's lives, inviting transformational shifts. ...is my ease with myself and others and my heartfelt openness and honesty. favorite books: the fountainhead and the magus. favorite movies: this is a tough one. i can say i just saw the miracle worker for the first time. it is a classic about teaching helen keller and i found it extraordinary. music: blues, new age, folk, classic rock food: i enjoy all kinds but am especially fond of asian food. my children, love, opportunities for expression, exploration, authenticity, and (all that is required for survival) how to help bring more consciousness into the world, including myself. with my daughter going to a movie, playing a game, doing something creative. not sure. i'll let this question go. it strikes me as oddly funny. my profile resonates and you are on a path of consciousness as well.\n",

      "my username is an anagram for my actual name. this is my self summary. there are many like it across the internets but this one is for okcupid. it's kind of ridiculous attempting to summarize a person and all of their complexities in a little tiny box but here's the best that i have to offer right now.  i am not a mind reader or a svengali and i don't like mind games but i will be there for you when you need a hand or a favor. i care deeply about my family and friends and i recognize that i can't help everyone. i have somewhat high expectations of my friends and don't really care for drama or indecisiveness. laughter, kindness, compassion and an appreciation for the beauty this amazingly wonderful world has to offer are traits i seek in others.  i love finding new places to eat and going there with friends or family and talking to my parents who are truly two beautiful people, each in their own uniquely wonderful ways.  i've been very fortunate to get to do things that many people only dream of doing and for that i'm very grateful, but i still have lots more spectacular and amazing gifts to share with the world. some of those gifts are just starting to emerge.  i am disaffected, musical, and an oxygen breather got hired full-time in april '11 after being a contractor at apple from just after thanksgiving in november of 2009. still making and selling music online here: http://mp3.belief-systems.com/ and here: http://nudephotomusic.com/ lot's of stuff including making electronic music, djing back in the good ol daze, taking photographs of people, places and things. i also like to hike, bike, walk and exercise on my home work out machine and make healthy juice in my breville centrifugal juice fountain. carrots, apples, oranges, pears, beets, even ginger; you name it, we've probably juiced it. i really have no clue as to what people notice about me right off the bat. i hope that some of the people i meet here will let me know. this is a ridiculously long list i've got to grab from my old myspace profile. we'll just say, coming soon for now. my awesome cats. my folks. my good friends. my ipod with tons of music on it. my amazingly quiet and sound isolated bedroom where i can escape the cold, or the light when i stay up a little late and need to sleep during the day. i'm a vampire by nature. the day job forces me into the light but i would prefer to go to bed just before the sun comes up. it's hard to find good jobs that support this time arrangement though. the absurdity of life and all of it's material trappings and how much i covet silly things that ultimately have no meaning in the grand scheme of things. out at a bar with friends, seeing a movie, having dinner at an amazing restaurant, watching a movie at home or just downloading movies or music on the couch. i don't need to go out all the time anymore. i used to go out almost every night but i'm less restless than i used to be. nothing. you don't take yourself to seriously, you can have a laugh at silly jokes, don't require a tremendous amount of maintenance and are not psychotic, don't suffer from bpd (this is borderline personality disorder, btw) and you are not a sociopath. for a definition of what i mean by sociopath, look here:  http://www.mcafee.cc/bin/sb.html\n",

      "i live vicariously through movie quotes. when i'm not hiking, taking pictures, or tossing a frisbee, i'm probably wishing i were doing so. i've skiied two black diamonds, but i fell a lot. i've jumped out of a perfectly good airplane. i'll try most anything once. many years ago, i spun a techno show on my college radio station. i can make a magnet out of an ordinary piece of metal. i think i still have a slap bracelet around here somewhere. i'm good at fixing things.  obviously, i try not to take myself too seriously. i love talking to people about a wide variety of subjects, from technology to books to love to war to politics.  i am enigmatic, affable, and loquacious i'm writing this profile. more long-term goals include dinner, then a good book.  more long-term, i'm enjoying the life of consulting for a large consulting firm, hopping from project to project. it entails thinking on my feet, adapting to new situations, and constantly learning new things. i'm building a solid foundation of knowledge and expertise, and big companies just love that.  i'm bitter that i still haven't scaled katahdin (it was sleeting!). while i love the city, i could see myself living in the wilderness for a few years, or perhaps a prairie. or down under. or up over! no, in all seriousness, i'd love to visit australia and new zealand. i have a strong wanderlust that i fulfill every so often. i love to travel, and i'm always looking for companions to accompany me on new adventures.  outside of work, you'll find me biking around the bay area. i'm also into photography, an occasional run, and looking longingly out the window at the water. i'm ridiculously good at responding to these \"what are you good at?\" questions. you've stuck with me this far, right?  i guess i'm good at not being serious. there is a time and a place for sound, logical arguments and discussions. i love having those. but not in little windows with only courier new to defend myself! i'd much rather have a discussion over a glass of wine or a tasty wheat beer in a new cafe we've just discovered.  people tell me they love my photography. i don't get out and photograph as much as i'd like, but i do love it. i'd throw frisbee in the list (no pun inten-- aw, hell, sure it was), but i haven't scrolled down yet, and i'm sure i can whip out that disc somewhere else where it would be more useful. if there were one thing people always noticed about me, i'd probably build up some sort of complex about it and go live in a cave.  kidding. people generally tend to notice that i'm always listening. i'd rather fully understand what you have to say than to cut you off and ask for clarification. i pride myself in being a good listener, and a good friend. hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, chuck palahniuk, philip k. dick, watership down, snow crash, house of leaves, the alchemist, time traveler's wife, kite runner. but don't get me wrong, there's plenty of grisham, crichton, and ludlum on my bookshelves!  on a recent trip home, i dusted off a book of logic that lay forgotten, the byproduct of a college logic class dropped due to time constraints. so i read it cover to cover, and then purchased a philosophy i textbook... we'll see where this goes!  as for movies: \"waking life\" is both irresistibly charming and mind-numbingly boring at the same time. i love it! of course, other favorites include pi, fear and loathing in las vegas, requiem for a dream, lives of others, into great silence (bonus points if you've actually seen that!), the wall, fargo, reservoir dogs, lock stock, snatch, pulp fiction, spaceballs. most any judd apatow film.  food-wise, i'm a big fan of thai, indonesian, and sushi. this is definitely not a city for picky eaters. i'll try most anything once. light, shadow, music, love, my camera, and a good book. light. the best time for photography is in the last half hour before sunset, when the streets turn amber and shadows grow longer. shadow. i love the night. i wake up early for work, but i'll always be a night owl.  sound. music will always get me going. i haven't been clubbing in a while, but i'll always love trance and techno. it's been a while since i've played piano (for which i had free lessons for a month), and i'd really like to pick it up again. (playing, that is). shooting pool, hanging out at the bar or lounge with friends, or dancing in a club. that being said, i'm just as happy to have a chill quiet evening with a few friends, some wine, and a good movie. it's good to mix it up, and i'm not picky as long as the company is good! i've never climbed katahdin -- it was snowing and they'd closed the trails. i may be on the opposite coast now, but i'll be back there to hike it! you're drawn to my savvy wit like a moth to a flame. though i won't discriminate; you could be any winged insect drawn toward any sort of incendiary device.  i'm always looking to meet new people, and this is a great way to discover people you might not otherwise ever get the chance to meet. if you'd like to have an intelligent conversation about politics, a silly one about monty python, or just swap movie quotes, drop me a line.\n",
      "i would say my defining trait is an overdeveloped sense of curiosity. i love new ideas, new experiences, and discovering new things about myself and others. this probably explains why i am thoroughly addicted to ted talks and wikipedia. i enjoy good conversation, hanging out with friends, and travel abroad. i've never really gotten into team sports or working out, but i like to keep active and spend time outdoors, so i'll go running, biking, or hiking when i have the time. i'm in love with the pacific ocean, and am constantly on the lookout for excuses to go down to the beach, if only to listen to the waves crashing on the shore. enjoying it. more prosaically, i'm a ph.d. student in electrical engineering at stanford university. my research is in photonics, which basically means i get to come up with new ways of playing with light. being distracted, figuring out logic puzzles, making english toffee, remembering useless trivia, getting myself in over my head and somehow coming out okay in the end. i'm told that i come across as thoughtful - especially in the sense that i tend to think things through before jumping in, maybe a bit too much. my tastes are pretty varied, but here's a sample.  books: the unbearable lightness of being, gdel escher bach, anansi boys, the city & the city, the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy movies: the fall, once, the man from earth, stardust, everything is illuminated, pan's labyrinth tv shows: firefly, doctor who, avatar: the last airbender, cosmos, jim henson's the storyteller, pushing daisies music: mumford & sons, the weepies, rilo kiley, metric, vienna teng, amber rubarth, regina spektor, mates of state, zemfira food: seafood, salads, fresh fruit, garlic, curry (anything spicy, really), dark chocolate, and of course, hot tea tea books bicycle music farmer's markets laughter physics, mathematics, language, ethics, people, life going to a movie or a pub with friends, working late at the lab (if i have to), or getting ready for a weekend trip. i've seriously tried to learn how to dance (i took a few social dance classes in college, and i've had lessons in west coast swing), but it never seems to take. every time, i'll thoroughly enjoy myself for a while, and then promptly forget everything once i haven't done it for a few weeks. maybe one of these times something will finally stick. - you're fascinated by the universe and want someone to share that fascination with. - you chose okcupid over other dating sites because you liked the statistical analyses on oktrends. - you have an interesting question to ask or story to tell.\n",

      "i'm not the best at describing myself on things like this, but i'll give it a shot. one of the things i enjoy most in life is to laugh. i have a good sense of humor,and i like those around me to laugh as well. i tend to walk the line between hopeless romantic and realist lately, though i've always leaned toward the romantic. the pisces description for me is pretty right on. sometimes i do find myself living in a dream world of my own imagining (not in the insane sort of way). i enjoy staying in and watching tv (scrubs, simpsons, family guy, futurama) or curling up with a good book (mostly of the fantasy genre). i also like to get out and hit up a bar or sit around playing board games with some friends (i can kick some serious butt at cranium). i've been out of the serious dating game for a while now, and i feel like it's time to get back out there and meet new people.  i am silly, intelligent, and a dreamer went to school at stanford university. majored in chemical engineering. currently a corporate tool for a prosthetics and orthotics company. what's that have to do with my area of study? surprisingly little. falling asleep absolutely anywhere and maintaining that state through almost any noise but whispering (weird i know, but i'm nosy). since i've started shaving my head, it's definitely the lack of hair. after that, my green-brown eyes. if they aren't actually within sight of me, i've been told my laugh can be heard from down the block. a) ender's game (and the ender's shadow series) by orson scott card, harry potter books by j.k. rowling (yeah, i admit it), wheel of time books by robert jordan. right now i'm going back to my junior high days and rereading the david eddings's series.  b) anchorman, wedding crashers, 40 year old virgin, old school, batman begins, lord of the rings, finding nemo, juno  c) i like a little bit of everything.  d) gino's east chicago-style pizza, made in chicago...none of the imitation chicago-style stuff. also a big fan of anything barbecue. hot water, internet, creme brulee, coke, chicago style deep dish pizza, contacts (blind as a bat without them lol) what ifs. living a life with no regrets is impossible for me. drinking beer with friends or drinking beer playing a computer game. also started going for a bike ride after work to get rid of all the stress of the week. i liked buffy the vampire slayer,and i've seen every single episode. a) simpsons quotes are a natural part of your conversation. b) your friends constantly tell you that you just aren't right in the head sometimes. c) you like joking around with a laid back, down to earth guy. d) all of the above are true.\n",

      "i'am the kind of person who loves life enough to grow and change.for me living here in san francisco means never a dull moment,either a night out with friends or a quiet night in with music or a movie.i am very greatfull to have peace and serenity along with hope of finding that someone special to share it with in the coming year. creating found toy sculptures while continuing to work in the culinary field focusing on nutrition while enjoying my spare time playing music.all of this is possible because the grace i have recieved in recovery. making people laugh ,taking the time to take the right path,looking for the oppertunity to be of service and finding that good bass line. my outgoing personality, sense of humor and my unique choices for eyeware. i recently reread on the road ,candide and i' ve caught devo ,tom tom club and the fixx live this year.i'm a new fan of phoenix,passion pit and empire of the sun and steely dan, the police,beatles,joe jackson,miles and coltrain are old favorites.i'm a chef/cook here in the city ,total \"foodie\".i cool many and enjoy most fair.i frequent the castro theater to get my film fix on.i would like to go to the theatre more to expand my cultural sense.i'm also a big fan of museums and everthing to do with art. my sobriety, my kitten oboe ,cool eyeware, my art,nice threads,cool tunes. how can i make it better ie.food, music someones day. a meeting then rehearsal then dinner or movie. i have obsession with eyeware....oops my bad if your into a geniunely,honest ,funny ha ha not funny strange,eclectic never a dull moment or coversation kind of chap!!\n",
      "i'm a sparkly, feisty, budding-geek who has lived in san francisco for 8 years.  i've been through a lot of wild phases in a short period of time so i consider this to be part two of my teenage years (minus the angst and bad skin).  i know a lot of people say this, but i really am looking for someone to go on adventures with; underground parties, skydiving, hot springs, camping. i'm something of an adrenaline junkie and i'll try almost anything at least once. and i'm also on the market for a laughing buddy because i love laughing more than is probably socially acceptable.  i should also mention that i'm married and poly. so if you're down with that, lets chat. i have a degree in psych and am working on a bio-tech certification.  i have an interest in studying neurology and abnormal psychology. i spend a lot of time trying to figure out why people do the things they do. the performing arts. well, maybe i shouldn't say it's what i'm really good at, but it makes me happy. acting and singing are my styles of choice.  and i make ridiculous costumes to satisfy my need for exhibitionism.  also i've been known to wrestle women in lubricant. ya know... just here and there. my hair, my eyes, and ridiculous amounts of energy. i can charming when i really try, but it mostly comes out as goofy, and quirky. books; anais nin, henry miller, jamaica kincaid, frederick douglass, anne golon, carl jung  movies; musicals, documentaries, period pieces, thrillers, cheesy action movies, even cheesier horror movies  tv; mad men, archer, true blood, damages, the daily show, xena  music; es posthumus, beats antique, kaizers orchestra, hans zimmer and anything from an action move soundtrack... i'm, also kind of a pop-crack fiend... this includes lady ga-ga, old-school madonna, ke$ha, and post-crazy britney spears  food; spanish, french, ethiopian, almost anything actually just... please no sushi.... warmth food water shelter safety pizza defying stereotypes and shifting paradigms. either thrashing about wildly on the dance or chatting up at a party. or curled up in bed watching a movie. i sometimes fantasize that i'm christine from phantom of the opera... especially when i'm in the shower. i'm super into awkward eccentrics. so if you have the tendency to be inappropriate and off-beat let's chat. we'll have drinks and discuss alien flicks and reddit.  also, i'm extremely partial to pit-bull owners, best dogs known to man\n",
      "enjoying life through travel and working in cleantech! i'm hanging out in the bay area for the summer, living with a bunch of guys and girls in a house in bayshore, and biking a lot to work. i want to meet new people to go out with, nothing serious since i'll be gone in september! i'm doing a lot of energy-related stuff, with the idea that i'll go back to school for some sort of physics-related activity.  i like doing random outings, like going to make cheese at a creamery, pretending to be in a band, going all out for a glow-in-the-dark party...maybe i'll even like sitcoms one day. soccer :d and going out to dinner, biking, and whatever else is in the area. right now my big thing is wearing my hat on adventures.  and try me out on this, but i think i can cook a good meal or two, and definitely a good carrot cake. call me out on the spot haha, its the best way to do it. mlngma - my last name gets mispronounced a lot. i'm gonna go with galapagos, inception, arrested development, ludacris, and bay area soul food. adventure, the outdoors, awesome hotels, one clean set of clothing, good shoes on my feet, and occasional female company hehe. taking experiences and abstracting their concepts...and what to eat. playing soccer late, out to a concert, having a good chat with a friend, or being dragged out to a bar.  definitely going to be out around town this summer, but my house has 14 people living in it so we tend to have awesome house parties where we do whatever. some guys smoke, some drink, some just play n64 -- its a blast. i just learned that i did my taxes for april 2011 to april 2012, and not jan 1st to dec 31st :( you want to actually do stuff in the city, have a fun chat and dinner, watch a cool act, go trolling, do a fun drinking game, and hang out to cook some food with friends.\n",

      "i moved to san francisco about a year ago and i'm still learning about new places to explore. i'm working for a game company and having fun (read: lots of ping pong) while doing it. i'm still trying to balance work and life since i live in the city and work down south, so that's what my weekends are for. i'm generally a nice guy and keep an even tempered mood throughout. i try to be funny around my friends and it either leaves with them laughing or me - a good time had either way in my opinion. i graduated a couple of years ago and more recently have been working as a web developer at a company that makes online games. meanwhile, i try to go to the gym a couple of days a week or out for a run. i've also been wanting to try rock climbing for a while, but just haven't found a good time. other than that, i work on small web projects during my free time, or hang out with friends in the city. pointing out the good and bad things - mostly bad things - websites do, listening to others, trying new things, and being 5 minutes late. my beard (if i haven't shaved that day) and my smile. someone also said that i was ethnically ambiguous; i'm still wondering if i should feel insulted or not. :) movies: saw 1, shawn of the dead, zombieland, inception, dark knight, bridesmaids, jurassic park, casino royale and there are probably a ton more that i'm forgetting.  books: dan brown books, harry potter, steve jobs biography, ender's game, the adventures of sherlock holmes, hunger games.  shows: damages, battlestar galactica, queer as folk, lost, community, modern familiy, and hell's kitchen.  music: coldplay, civil twilight, the faunts, glitch mob, amy winehouse, foster the people, young the giant, third eye blind.  food: generally i'll eat most foods if they're not too fried or greasy. right now i'm in the mood for clam chowder in a bread bowl from the wharf... music friends ping pong laughter internet that bread with the sunflower seeds on it - so good. typography, websites, (wanting to) rock climb, i should start saving, how to get from a to b without paying for a zipcar, and the futureeee (those e's are silent - it's an echo). usually just relax at home since i've just gotten home. i do more on saturdays: hanging out with friends, going to the park or going out to dinner/bar/club and having fun. ...on this site...where we already answered a bunch of really specific sex questions...  how about: i actually enjoy doing my laundry (when i remember). i just stuff the clothes in a washer, then a dryer, and its pretty much done. not much to it. you want to say hello and maybe get to know me better.\n",
      "i am not, three, adjectives. i do comedy while standing up, read and diagnose ekg strips while sitting down, and put my study of philosophy to no practical application in either scenario.  i also do that thing where you play other people's music, and take all the credit for it. then i go and actually make music with other people. which i also take all the credit for.  and i'm a student, but sometimes, i think it's the students who teach me. exploiting syntactical errors; learning from my mistakes, then moving on to making bigger, more expensive mistakes; wielding the counter-intuitive; tasteful self-deprecation; modesty!; navigating on back roads relying entirely on cardinal directions; identifying those recurring 'hey, it's that guy' actors we've all seen but never remember; mragasan; picking out the wrong gift; pleading for store credit; amusing alliteration (like parenthetical playfulness); illusory alliteration. and beginning sentences with conjunctions, for added potency. my petite proboscis, and flowing locks of golden ember atop my nod. followed by my sarcasm. followed by my big nose and shaved head.  as for things you should knowtice about me, i'm a moderate drinker who appreciates his poison-of-choice within a social context (besides, i don't have the genetics for inebriation.) so if you wanna get way smashed buzzed on a friday thursday night, i'm your palestinian prince.  here's another linestrike linestrike. i like my movies driven by dialog, my music driven by depth, and my books driven by booth.  and my food driven to my home.  all lists available upon request. might prove more insightful to just compile a list of things i'd actually be quite comfortable doing away with:  1. people who go out of their way to ensure that their voices creak upon hitting vocal deflections.  2. fashionable, self-edifying activism, of any kind.  3. those who are rude and discourteous to strangers.  4. this paper-thin adult swim culture of 'awesome!' nostalgia (no, i'm not coming to your totally awesome back to the future party where we all dress up like our favorite labyrinth characters and bring ninja turtles themed pastries while listening to the sixteen candles soundtrack at your best friend's band's place in the cityyyy-ee-eeee. oh, and during an impending/ongoing zombie apocalypse, naturally.)  5. people who use only five items to complete lists of six. moonlit valleys, distant streams; approaching storms; eerie beauty, ominous clouds, distant foghorns, ominous journal entries, anomalies, coastal drizzle, distant lights, stillness of night. drafting innistrad, playing standard constructed, hoping you don't know what any of this means.  also, at borders barnes & noble, trying to determine why there never ceases to a hardbound book on the celts and/or stonehenge in the bargain books section. really, i can't imagine a single author or publisher has made a profit off this subject since 1996. i can only type with the use of my index fingers, but can do so at a fast loud 110+ wpm coastal fog and overcast warms you like sunshine on a clear summer day.  you take delight in the pleasant simplicities in your life, and in a life shared with someone else.  you're otherwise capable of determining this independent of my help.\n",

      "mmmmmmmm... let's see. two things i can't quite break free of. my tattoos (for obvious reasons) and my bangs (somewhere between a betty page and a crissy hynde).  i love doggies and kitties, t-shirts, and boxing. i've been studying the sweet science for the past 12 years and have been involved in kickboxing and martial arts since my early 20's. i still have my dream of fighting pro someday, but for now my main events occur only in the gym. we have to work with what our strengths are; mine just happen to be pugilistic in nature.  i am a fitness professional. i teach boxing, bootcamp, and circuit training. so as you can imagine, working out and eating right are a huge part of my lifestyle. but i'm not madonna and i don't eat dirt. i love food and don't mind a few extra minutes (hours!) of exercise to burn off a sweet session of hedonism.  my buddies would say that i am a \"tough girl with a sweet side\". i tend to think of life in terms of a journey rather than a destination. i always stop to smell flowers and stoop to pet doggies. cheezy i know, but so is love and romance, right?  i don't really have a \"type\" that i look for. i think i am attracted most to the unique things that set you apart from others. kindness, intelligence, being a good listener are all good qualities. also, you gotta make me laugh! out loud even! eventually want a partner in crime, a clyde to my bonnie, someone who will stand back to back with me with sawed off 12 gauges when the zombie apocalypse comes. or maybe one of us can mow down the undead while the other reloads (can't we find any automatic weapons with banana clips around here?). and when we finally become outnumbered and we go out fighting, i can be happy to die by your side or off you when you start to change. is that so much to ask?  my favorite sense is olfaction...followed closely by gustation.  some people say i look like sanda bullock. i take it as a compliment.  east coast working class italian reformed catholic.  i am strong, smart, and spunky what am i doing?

      "it's been said before... \"but i dislike writing these.\"... ok, now that i'm over that. i moved here a year ago from seattle and am still exploring and growing. there's a lot to see here and its great that there is enough sun here to go out and do it! if i'm not scheming on my next road trip, its doing something out in the town with friends (brunch is a weekend favorite!). i like to stay active, have a variety of passions and interests, and am down for chatting/meeting with new people if we fit. seriously, don't be shy, say hello and let's see where it goes. still exploring my relatively new home of california, hanging with friends, grinding away at my job, and just living the life i want while still taking everyday as it comes. i have an amazing job that provides enough for me to live my life without (work) consuming it. making people laugh, cooking, dancing, random information, and political mediation among conflicting groups. :-) was once told by a friend, \"everytime i think of you all i wanna do is give you giant hugs.\" i took it there was something she liked. i love articles, journals more over than books. i'm big on staying up to date on world affairs so i'm constantly reading something.  movies i can sometimes be pretty selective and then other times completely go for what is cheesy gooey goodness. depends on the mood. royal tennenbaums is always a favorite!  music is to vast to list here, have over 60 gigs and still growing.  food: put it in front of me and i'll eat it. seriously there is nothing not to love. i am also a pretty good cook. oh god i don't know without sounding cliche!? the weekend(s), work, politics, places to travel, and activities for my friends and i to do.... and then effing doing them!!!! :-) hanging out with friends, chilling out, seeing a concert/show, out to the bars, gone dancing, camping, etc..... wherever and whatever feels right or was planned for that weekend but i like to keep things pretty loosey goosey. back in seattle i used to participate in the naked bike ride parade every solstice if you like what you read, someone who is fun and independent, can hold a conversation, loves to be active and is actually interested in getting to know someone not just the inside lining of their pants give me a shout. looking for friends, dating, and if mr. right should happen to swing by i might take him too.  please do not message me if you are not over 21. i do enjoy my variety of adult beverages and would like to find someone who does too.\n",
      "for the last decade or so i've been somewhat a nomad by choice. between undergrad, grad, and a couple jobs i've found myself in a different city on average every 2-3 years. so things would have it that i've stumbled into some good fortune, having found my way to the same timezone as the rest of my family.  i am new to sf, observant, and likes rice. i work at a tech startup which i enjoy tremendously more than the large mega corp i worked at before. that being said, i find myself strangely nostalgic of dead-end post-lunch meetings...and powerpoint.  oh and if you know anything about social entrepreneurship, i think you're neat. making people laugh and feel comfortable, unless they're snobby in which case i enjoy long awkward conversations. i shave my head. i've got broad shoulders. i look like a particular tennis player. most h. hesse novels, joseph conrad stories, and most books about bees, except that one...yeah, you know the one.  music wise, i like beirut and the killers, and some sufjan stevens. 1. family 2. coffee thermos 3. iphone 4. building stuff 5. people trying to make an impact 6. adventure building and designing stuff, and what i might be forgetting. usually out eating and drinking with folks and trying to figure out the best way to get from a to b in a city without subways. i'm mysterious. your natural state is cheerful, you like reading, travel, and chocolate.\n",
      "i am back and glistening with life energy from a forest where fire raged five years ago, the trees lived but were stripped bare which gave the floor of the forest light and the ground was littered with new seedlings, new trees reaching for the canopy of stars. i danced while waves of music crashed over me, laughter in the trees, hot fire burning in me.  \"we tend to think of the erotic as an easy, tantalizing sexual arousal. i speak of the erotic as the deepest life force, a force which moves us toward living in a fundamental way... the erotic is a measure between our sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings.\" -- audre lorde i am coming back into my own, which means being open and connected to spirit, new growth and community. i am cleaning house on many levels and making space for new life. i have lived through a dark winter of loss, but in releasing that i reconnected myself to my heart's desire. i need truth, the language of love is trust, the personal is political, how we treat people and ourselves matters. i am deep in school right now, and running a small music distribution business. volunteering and looking for another part time job. i am applying to ciis soon, but probably not till the lucky year of 2013! i am active and engaged. i play music, if that is what djing is? i like to go out and hear music, dance and have a good time more times sober than not. i tend to follow my intuition and embrace the passions that move me, reading and learning. i think i have found that i want to keep changing and growing with each person that crosses into my life, and to be there for the people that make it into my heart. i am a spiritual person, it is my thing, so i am not looking to steal your soul but it would be great to find a partner that could work magick with me and live connected to nature and the seasons. lately i have been feeling free for the first time in quite awhile, responsible for myself, and it has been good. i am writing everyday sometimes letting go to automatic writing and poetry, not just editing this. people have been friendly and old friends have told me i am a sorce of light again (probably just an albino thing), i had lost that sparkle and i have learned some lessons, not happening again for a long time....i have an overwhelming feeling that this is going to be an innana year for me. may the pain of loss feed the growth of me. i hope that i never use that line. i am really good at sleeping, cooking, sexing, funning, ah yes brushing . please alright come on, i am for real, i am flawed but not tragically, i am a balancing act. an edge walker, an intuitive, and holding those spaces in a society like this one has made me strong and grounded. oh yeah some people dig my music that i play here is a little something, a work in progress.... http://soundcloud.com/tomkat-the-feral-dj/post-kontrol6-2-2012 it is my hair, everyone wants my hair or skin. it is a bit tiring being ided at 40 and people guessing my age at 27, i have been in my late 20s for an eternity. i am actually pretty chill with it, but when you are 1 in 10,000 due to a simple set of hidden genetic traits, i am also mistaken for every other white albino that anyone has ever known, i have yet to use this to my advantage. but i have been considering telling people that yes, i am the albino from shortbus. i would like i mean love to be with a partner with a real connection to dance music or electronic music in general. there is no better place to have one of those rare ecstatic experiences than on a dance floor. i thought i could do without this, but it is part of me and i want to share that joy with another person. i made the tragic mistake of giving up going to parties and embracing my music for my last partner, and i even consented to sex under duress of bad music. i feel like i just told you that i am a whore, i thought i could take it, i thought how bad could pho emo metal really be? really bad, damaging, it took weeks of therapy and strong drugs to wash that psychic sodomy out of my system. all better now.  i am very music oriented to me music is the perfect fusion of the physical and ethereal. i am into house, techno, dub, drone, folk, lots of odds and ends, all grrl bands, indie, experimental, industrial, motown, some punk not so much hip hop or country. recently i danced at mazzy star, zola jesus, honey, dan bell and got completely spaced with a dark dirty gothstep set by demdike stare. i like my music and am generally open to new things. i am into the live experience, so lets get it on and go to a show. i am not gonna grind on anyone, i am one of those people that go deep into the music.  books...yes yes yes. like jon waters, i refuse to have sex with people that do not have books, the kindle is no replacement for the tenderly loved library. i tend to be reading a couple things at a time, from pulp to history to occult to smut to graphic novels. i never used to read fiction then neil gaiman changed my world. i like the themes of magical realism. stuff i am reading right now...urban tantra, nomad codes, when the body says no, dicked (dark fiction inspired by dick cheney), playing with taboo, elf girl, anointed: a devotional anthology for the deities of the near and middle east,  tv and movies...i somehow got free cable from the internet dude, but i never look at that thing. i am always surprised to learn that tv is still going on. i like movies and shows like the wire or 6 feet under, as long as the series is a tool for telling a truth or showing an evolution. i like escapist movies but only sometimes, but generally i like movies that are smart, sharp, a bit dark, and leave me wanting more.  food, i like you, very much. i like cooking and my dowry is a set of perfect iron pans, half vegetarian and half not. i am an official representative from team kale and collards. i would really like to find a friend or partner that can share the joy of going to the produce market, creating something together that feeds us. people have described me as an healthy eater. i sometimes eat junk food, but i do try to make what i eat count for something. i am a tea drinker, and know more about herbalism and different health modalities than a room full of western doctors. i do some massage, but am not a cmt. 1. heart 2. my music collection 3. cats 4. laughter 5. connection & communication 6. honesty 7. a willingness to change and adapt 8. this is complex but to feel both the deep sadness and suffering that is so heavy in the world esp. right now, and find a balance with the positive, transformative nature of life, after the winter comes spring.  some things i could just do without forever... 1. the either arrogant or agressive idiots 2. this might refer to point number one, but all the people who think their god should dictate my life and are seeking to criminalize reproductive freedom 3. can people just stop being so damn short sighted, maybe frac ing is the worst idea of all time, posion all the water in an ecosystem for forever, among other travesties, i try to think about rainbows and unicorns but end up remembering the stupid stupid way we destroy all in the name of growth, progress, money. bleh,. how to do better in life, be more patient and spending more time with people i care about, and learning to care more deeply for people that i do not know.  sex, of course, but more like energy and sex, how can i have more non genital full body orgasms? tantra always bothered..me all the books were by men, and it seemed so neu age, then i met people that move energy like me that are more dynamic and pragmatic. i am teaching myself some stuff but would like to find people that are interested in playing with this path or practise.  what came first the serpent or the egg?  was jesus the first zombie?  communication and boundaries, i am really interested in cultivating more relationships that strive to be both deeply connected and validating for the individual. i am not sure how that will work but when there can be balance like that, things feel healthy. i hope there is never an easy answer for a question like this, i would like to say whatever i want to be doing. i don't want my life to drift into typical patterns, i do not own an old man chair yet. however there is a day bed instead of a couch in the living room. i really like it when women make the first move, i am not shy so much as i would like to live in a culture where that is cool.  i am in the process of creating some new dreams in my life, i would like to have more people i love and am engaged with, i am pretty sure that until find more of myself, i am not looking for a traditional relationship. i would love to have a life filled with love and friends and meaning, support for growth, honesty and connection. if the world ended, i want to remember all the people i loved and love has so many forms. i am still working it all out. actually, just wanted to comment on the above, i am looking for a woman not a girl.  i value personal ethics and boundaries.  i am sex-positive and kink positive, safety and good communication are required. kink is maybe so broad and open of a description, but i have some good ideas but no compulsion or obsessions. i love to top, not super in touch with being a sub, but i am adventurous. i am open to trying things so take that as refreshing or liberated or however.  i am cool with poly/open people, and single people, but i really do not want to be involved with anyone not being honest. i am holding onto singledoom right now to give me time to grow and learn more about myself and how i can be a better person. i would definately consider a relationship, if we had the chemistry and interests.  i also do not really know what casual sex is, kids today and i suppose older generations have this thing called casual sex, i have had lovers that that is how we connected but things were never casual, sex somewhere between the sacred and the profane, i feel like it can be never like sweatpants.  i do not care about the stupid crap that other dudes seem to care about ie: gender roles, status symbols, sports, taming a wild fem or a person having children. i am a pretty guy...no no i am a man and i think and feel things that seem to not be what most guys know about. i am looking forward to a world where the duality theory of everything is shitcanned like creationism. along those lines, madonna and whore syndrome and the male good/bad cop thing can be defragged, we as people have the ability to be both and more. we can live mythic lives--it is something often forgotten, dreams die when we forget them.  i hate iming lets go for a walk or do something fun, i am open and damn free right now. if you want to make some beauty and embrace a life to be in love with. i want that and more.\n",

(500) days of summer. once. fiona apple. eisley. almost famous. there will be blood. shakespeare. infinite jest. the xx. walden. bon iver. joanna newsom. the bbc's sherlock. hayao miyazaki. feist. the joy formidable. anna karenina (constantine levin is my literary hero). i actively appreciate the work of zac efron, and i'm not even kidding. songs: ohia. julianna barwick. pessoa's the book of disquiet. mad men. community. there are a thousand other things i could put here if i thought you wouldn't get bored by reading it. i'd list more music if i thought i could bare to narrow it down any. puppies tied up on the street by their owners for me to pet for a while. i always oblige. if i was in the matrix, i would say \"books. lots of books.\" a perfect slice of pizza. bicycles. or, at least, my bicycle. three showers a day. i love my shower. i love any shower. i love all showers. well-written prose and poetry. my friends and how it's impossible for me to solve their problems for them even if i wish i could.  also, why i'm (fairly) good with words, but so bad at words with friends and scrabble.  one of my readers once told me: \"you've been a vital part of my maturation as a human being.\" and that was probably the nicest thing anyone ever said to me. i think a lot about living up to the expectations of people who've never even met me. dancing, drinking, karaoke, watching movies. i find that, although i've come to dancing later than most, i really enjoy it despite being fairly bad at it. i suppose the same is true of drinking, although i've become fairly good at that, at least. and while we're on the subject, i enjoy karaoke despite being good at only a few songs, with build me up buttercup being a speciality. i have a puppy blog. i'm not even going to try and explain that statement. i have a puppy blog. that kinda says it all. and i don't even own a dog. i will not show it to you until we meet in person. things have to be explained. ...you like ellipses...\n",

      "generally you'll find me at home in my giant la-z-boy watching movies or playing with some project that i'm never going to finish. i'm an avid comic book collector and generally kind of a technology geek. i'm particularly fond of old horror comics like ec comics (is that redundant?) and eerie and creepy. i also dream of doing much more with my arduino than i imagine that i ever actually will.  but i don't stop at self-identifying as a nerd, and i'm not completely socially hopeless or awkward. no, really. i am also into punk rock and hanging out at the park. i like catching baseball games and hanging out with my friends. mostly just keeping my head above water. i work in a museum doing tech stuff 5 days a week, and then i have been going to school a couple classes a semester at city college waiting on an ever-distant transfer. i also work a volunteer shift at a record store called thrillhouse. i'm linking to that because i've realized that i'm no longer ashamed of my okcupid profile now that everyone's got one. one of my friends is going to find me on here and either think that's adorable or make fun of me. being really lazy. probably some goofy shirt i've got on. i think whether or not one likes mst3k is a good judge of one's character. i like most sci-fi/fantasy/horror movies, particularly if they're not full of cgi. if tom savini worked on it, chances are i think it's awesome.  i read a lot of comic books, although admittedly i don't read too many real novels anymore (yes, i acknowledge that there's a difference). i used to though, so i'll probably know what you're talking about if you want to talk about one. i am really into dune.  i have been on a kick lately watching that mitchell and webb look and peep show. i love british humor (i've probably watched each of the monty python holy trinity a billion or so times).  i like food. i like food a lot. noodles, spring rolls, fried chicken, sushi, hot dogs, hamburgers, bulgogi, latkes... honestly i could make this list much longer than is necessary. juice boxes x6.  i really love minute maid juice boxes. mostly, \"duuuuuhhhhhhhhhhh\".  also, whether the bad brains are really good enough to still love even though they suck as people.  where do all these people on here get all this time for all these vacations? i have a volunteer shift at the record store from 4-8, and then i usually get into something from there. either i hang out at the store until 10 or 11 drinking and talking about how much i want to fix the street fighter ii arcade cabinet, and then wander down to a bar like the knockout or something, or i'll sometimes head over to some show or someone's house or something. i secretly want one of those guitars that are like two guitars. the top reasons that you should message me are...  - you've got some new dish that you want to make for someone. - you want to play board games. - you want to play some sort of ccg (like magic). - you want a new drinking buddy. - you want someone to learn something new with (like maybe how to cook) - you want to see a movie - you just want to hang out or talk to someone. - you want to go to there\n",

      "although i'm a pretty good writer, there is no way to write something about myself in a few sentences that is captivating and genuine without bullshitting or seeming arrogant. this difficulty is increased by the fact that you are supposed to write how great you are without seeming full of yourself. so, here goes.  overall, i like myself and most people usually like me, as well. most of the time, i can be described as kind, compassionate, intelligent, funny, sincere, honest and passionate. there are, however, times when less flattering adjectives apply. hopefully, you'll find the positive attributes so enticing that they outweigh the negative attributes (which i think pale in comparison to the positive attributes, but that's just me).  i am fortunate for many reasons; the number one reason being my 4 year old son. as you can see from his pictures, he is gorgeous. of course, i'm not biased at all. i was reluctant to include any pictures of him for fear it would be construed as exploitation. i finally decided to include his photos because a) he is such a huge part of my life; and, b) i'm not above exploitation if it facilitates me meeting the right person. :)  i am very lucky to have some unique, interesting, smart, funny, supportive friends with whom to spend time.  i usually like my job but there are days when i'd rather be independently wealthy (who wouldn't, right?) i'm a family law attorney, which is a nice way of saying \"divorce lawyer.\" (cue ominous music).  in terms of activities, when i'm not with my son or working, i love to ski, hike, play basketball, go river rafting, hanging out with friends and having drinks, seeing live music, etc. i play the piano (mainly blues) and love wood working.  i love to laugh (who doesn't?); i'm usually pretty funny. i have an overly indulgent sweet tooth (i like to think it is the sweet tooth's fault; not my lack of will-power). i love my family even though they can be certifiably crazy. although i'm confident in many ways, i can still be prone to bouts of neurosis. :)  ultimately, i'd like to meet the right person to share my life with but i'm not in a rush to find her. that being said, if i found the right person now, i'd be open to something serious but it is not a requirement at this point in my life.  hopefully we'll meet someday and either hit it off as friends or something romantic. being a father to my awesome son, working, laughing, hanging with friends, etc. (see above). giving massages laughing at myself (and others when appropriate and sometimes not so appropriate) fixing things and being handy. skiing (i used to be much better but i can still hold my own). playing songs on the piano by ear. my sense of humor; my smile. my rock-hard chisled abs. (i'm joking). favority movies: goodfellas, casino, young frankenstein, fisher king, swingers. favorite books: american psycho; and the band played on. music: blues; ozo matli (sp?); foo fighters; beastie boys. food: mexican, turkey sandwiches, chocolate chip cookies, good hummus (sp?). t.v. shows: seinfeld, dexter, weeds, six feet under, parenthood, 30 rock; the daily show. my son my friends chocolate chip cookies skiing playing the piano laughing revenge. (just kidding). my son. little things that i worry about but probably shouldn't. possibilities for a screen play. hanging out with friends spending time with my son fantasizing about mind-blowing inventions worth milliions of dollars. (if you ask me, i have a few good ideas for inventions, but maybe it is just me). i enjoy infomercials for products even though i know i will never use the product. you should message me if you are interested in a nice, thoughtful, funny, neurotic, usually charming, chivalrous guy who loves to laugh and you think we might have a good connection.\n",

      "if this song pretty much sums you up, just go ahead and message me now.  so i'm a nerd. i'm a game designer for a facebook game company (a start to what i see as a lifetime of making games); i play video games, dungeon and dragons, and magic: the gathering; i read comic books off my laptop (vertigo imprint mostly); i listen to 8-bit; and if this all sounds incredibly unattractive to you then i don't think we'll be able to get along.  to counteract this i bought myself a set of stylish clothes, registered for gilt.com, got myself a gq membership, went out to see the sfso, started ditching $5 burritos for $50 tasting menus, and got myself a rudimentary education in red wine.  so now people think i'm a gay nerd.  besides games, star trek, style, and grooming i also am fresh out of academia, and still enjoy talking about post-modernism and media theory from time to time. lgbtq friendly, feminist, and follow the general \"don't be a dick\" principle in life. it's like buddhism, but more grounded.  sometimes i use semicolons correctly to turn people on. i'll even throw in the occasional oxford comma.  okcupid has been just as good at finding friends for me as it has for finding dates, so i'm generally flexible. i'm ready to nerd rock, party down like chinatown, or dapper up like buttercup on any given weekend so if any (or all) of those sound appealing shoot me a line. i'm interested in people who are interested in me.  batman is fucking rad. oh god when did i become 25 derping.  derping is a biological condition that can occur as early as the onset of puberty to individuals into their late 40's. it is usually accompanied with herping, resulting in very dangerous situations (and sometimes arousing) instances of herp derp. derping usually is an aftereffect symptom of a short-term lapse of lowered intellect, or brought about by the increased stimulation of the michaelcerabellum, responsible for controlling the brain waves that control social awkwardness.  long term exposure to mentally debilitating activities can lead to permanent herp derpiness. doctors recommend individuals who value their intellectual wellbeing stay away from debilitating life habits such as long-term exposure to youtube comments, social conservatism, and birdemic.  for more on derping, please consult this respected medical resource on the phenomenon. when i was an undergrad on my final year i was walking down the street, bundled up against the thawing cold in my only stylish coat, inevitably to become my only well worn and thoroughly lived in. it was another day, another walk to perhaps class or the corner store for some eggs for dinner, or perhaps dinner itself in one of the cheap burrito or pizza places that littered the sides of thayer. bundled in with my scarf snugly (and also stylishly) around my neck and my black striped fedora on my head, i saw a young blonde walking towards me. i thought i saw her looking forward but then as i blinked her eyes were firmly planted on the ground, as if to make sure those steps in front of her really existed, as if they may give way into quicksand or some snow-covered hole in the ground. my sure steps and sense of direction were assured, confident, comfortable, and hers seemed unsure, inward, or perhaps just a little chilled from the providence cold. it was going to be a regular passing by of two people at the end of winter and beginning of spring (albeit with perhaps a quick but hopefully unnoticeable glance from me) when suddenly she looked up at me and met my eyes (from my probably less than unnoticeable glance).  \"i like your hat\" she whispered shyly before passing me by with a heartwarming smile.  my sense of adventure and sense of modesty then battled each other for a full 5 seconds before the former came out on top, telling me it was probably a good idea to ask her for her number or some tea, but at that point she was already a good 20 feet behind me, too far away for me to run up to her and ask in any graceful or unembarrassed way.  i still wear that hat. books: big fan of hariku murakami, lolita, ender's game & speaker for the dead (they go downhill after that), sherlock holmes, his dark materials trilogy, and used to read a lot of discworld. also good omens. a gesture life was pretty good. if you're into fantasy, check out the name of the wind  books with big pictures so they are easier to understand: neil gaiman. not just sandman but pretty much everything (like the original books of magic go trenchcoat brigade!). most of vertigo is also solid, including hellblazer (i like the garth ennis run a lot), y: the last man, and lucifer. blankets, adrian tomine, fun home, berserk (pretty much the only manga i'll read now), asterios polyp, maus, preacher, and a whole slew of other things. if you like graphic novels, ask me about it and lets talk!  movies: my favorite directors are park chan wook, michel gondry, and richard linklater. also to give you an idea, netflix keeps suggesting me dark, gritty, independent movies. and howl's moving castle  tv: please pop my firefly cherry.  music: neko case, rilo kiley, broken social scene, amon amarth, ben folds, regina spektor, asobi seksu, beirut, the ditty bops, ymck, dntel, rufus wainwright, and efterklang  video games: starcraft 2, the void, katamari damacy series, shadow of the colossus, fallout 1 & 2 (not 3), league of legends, planescape: torment, iji, and the left 4 dead series.  food: so here's how you make amazing chicken wings - get some chicken wings from the store. wash them out, then coat them in corn starch and/or flour then fry them in oil. next we've got the honey ginger soy sauce. what you're aiming for is something not too salty so go about 50/50 or 60/40 on the soy sauce to water ratio for the base. then add a liberal amount of honey, chop up some fresh ginger and garlic, maybe add some green onions, and also add some mirin (or sweet sake). also, sesame oil and sesame seeds are a must. stir that up and you should have a very sweet, somewhat thick, sauce due to the honeyness. you can also add some brown sugar if it needs more sweet. after you deep fried all those wings and got the sauce ready, get a big wok or giant pan and pan fry those wings with the sauce and coat while you cook. in the end you should have crispy, sweet, succulent, perfect honey soy ginger chicken wings. i don't think i'm forgetting anything there.  i'll also be willing to make you korean bbq. or fried ginger tofu if you're vegetarian/vegan.

      "i'm deep, grounded, and i like things good spirited and open hearted. i don't have a tv or care about professional sports. i spend a lot of time learning new things, exploring the world, getting sunshine, and building internet products (my cash cow.)  i'm a big fan of bondage - so i'm a good person to reach out to if you're \"curious.\" i can go from the tame to the extreme, and am not dungeons and dragons about it. yes, kink can be cool and not creepy.  because of a fortunate career, i have lots of time to make the most of my life, but it's the people who surround you who matter the most and that's where i'm trying to better. spontaneous drive to wine country or out to a creek for a swim? i might be your guy. especially if you have at least some interest in being tied to a tree when we're there (with your consent and totally optional of course;).  i've travelled much of the northern hemisphere, lived in china and speak mandarin.  i recently joined techshop and am learning to make just about anything out of anything with their amazing tools. i hope to make things around the house and of course some bondage equipment.  i have strong opinions, and am much better at keeping those to myself than i used to be.  if you want to read more, you can see my old profile - axilir. it's a good read by some accounts (which is why i kept it) but not quite me right now. building tech companies. learning to make things out of metal. being confident and social. keeping perspective. discussing ideas. bondage. i smile a lot. i have a cutting stare. i'm a small tight package. i haven't had a tv for 10 years, but i do watch shows on netflix, hulu, etc. i enjoyed weeds, californication, south park. mostly though i prefer life to provide entertainment, not tv, books or movies.  i do wish i read more though - i have trouble making time or having the patience. cliff notes ftw. meditation - there's just too much going on up there that i lose my grounding without daily meditation.  through meditation, you find there is really nothing you can't live without. well, besides meditation.  ok, cold showers and headstands too.  almost on that list would be my laptop. it provides me the power and freedom to make a living anytime and have a great lifestyle anywhere in the world. of course, i could \"make do\" without it though - i'd just be stuck in a more typical lifestyle (and perhaps happier for it.) why people do what they do, particularly people with \"issues,\" which is most of them. if i do the drinking thing, it's usually wine or super-fancy cocktails. i don't like excessive drunkenness or alcohol oriented culture, but it's hard to get away from. every few weeks or so, i usually feel completely different about the world and the people around me. sometimes that means i \"disappear.\" you want to spend a summer day having a picnic by beautiful creek, a night by a raging bonfire, or an afternoon in a remote hot spring.  you have time to do fun bold things, like take off to yosemite mid-week or get locked up in a basement as a sex slave for a few days (don't worry - i'll ask first).  especially message me if you like bondage - not necessarily because i'm going to tie you up, but because it means we'd probably get along well.  if you find my interest in bondage bothersome, but are starting to realize that's only because you're secretly into it.\n",
      "i recently moved from nyc to sf and am excited to meet some new people who can help me explore this amazing area...i have lived here before, but i was only 22, so its a little different now....  i am a tall, athletic and entrepreneurial guy. i work hard and play hard. i am spiritual, meaning i meditate and partake in my own personal growth, but i am not obsessed about it. i believe in balance, (and like most of us have had times where i was way out of balance)!  i love what i do, and do it well. i love being in nature, hiking in a forest is my glory, but also love the ocean and am taking up kite surfing. i am a kick-ass beach volleyball player and dabble in yoga (bikram), tennis, golf, and more...  i read a lot (varied stuff) and love movies, restaurants and have a passion about seeing as much of the world as i possibly can! i would love to have a partner in crime in this mission...  as for who i am looking for: i am typically attracted to creative women, someone who's got something going on...a girl that is 'up to' something in this life....always a big turn on.  i consider myself a very attractive guy...and i am certainly 'up to' something in my life :) i believe physical attraction is very important, and i need to feel that spark. i understand it doesn't necessarily last for 70 years, but its important nonetheless to have it there in the beginning....  i'm an internet marketing guy by trade...but have many other passions. hmmm, writing (don't you think?), making people laugh, being spontaneous, being a great friend.... i'm tall, athletic build, but most girls like my blue eyesss...... i am a big reader, love historical fiction (pillars of the earth, clan of the cave bear)....i dig ayn rand (atlas shrugged was amazing) and recently finished shantaram which you should read if you have an obsession with india, like me :) i also re-read the great gatsby recently and loveddd it....  as for movies, man, i'm a guy so i know like every line to every movie there ever was.... music my fam my meditation, or stillness, practice nature and trees my friends excitement for this life! how i can help change the world (for the better), and how i can improve myself. i am constantly striving to become a better person, a better listener, etc.... either out with friends or in a bikram yoga class (fridays are an awesome night for yoga) my secret tv obsession is the bachelor..... you like what you see...\n",

      "for the record, please take note that i'm seeing someone (which means i'm not amenable to polyamorous trysts or anything on the down low, just so you know), and while it's always fun to get random messages from strangers extolling my many visible and imagined virtues, i'm really into the fellow in my life. given that he was my first and only date on this site, i count myself among the lucky ones. :-)  about me:  writer, polymath, lucid dreamer, occasional blogger, collector of random thoughts, whimsy maker, wordsmith, lover of liminal spaces, armchair anthropologist, aesthete, flaneur, curiosity monger, humanist, apostle of marginalized voices, erstwhile circus performer, tantrika/taoist/sensualist, urban sophisticate, one foot before the other always. i am quixotic, uncontainable, and surprisingly goofy. most people would describe me as intense, but i'm full of \"bewitching dualities\" (that's a direct quote from someone i respect, so there), and they'd probably describe me as easygoing in the same breath. i'm spiritual but not a proselytizer, and although i prefer to take the path less traveled, i believe that all roads lead to rome. cliche as it is, i'm here to soak up every possible experience there is to be had, and to live, love, and leave nothing behind. i don't believe we're here to be saved, but to be eaten. fall down seven times, get up eight. writing (primarily, working on my next play and flitting from writing residency to writing residency), traveling, volunteering, getting my chi back to center, mining knowledge from the lacunae between dream and sleep and waking life, ruminating on the politics of dancing and feeling good. mismatching my socks, making up fake past lives, argentine tango, writing snarky dialogue that somehow manages to elicit heartfelt tears, putting together a pleasing sartorial ensemble, elucidating the health benefits of [fill in the blank], connecting kindred spirits, coming up with seventeen complicated synonyms for simple words, making people feel at ease, accepting you for who you are (warts and all), exercising forgiveness, attracting the affections of random critters, howling at the moon, brightening your days with random post-it notes, laughing at the absurdity and beauty of it all (i have an infectious laugh), listening, deriding dogmatism, living in the shadow, noticing the stuff most people don't, giving myself fully and ineluctably to the moment. my eyes, my clothes, my wild hair, my whimsy, my ineffable wit, my untrammeled creativity, the way i ever so skillfully straddle the hemispheres of sensual and cerebral, my ability to pay close attention, my keen memory, that certain je ne sais quoi. and let's be candid--i have a fantastic rack. oh my, this one is way too difficult. i'm an avid imbiber of culture. currently reading the new haruki murakami book but my tastes range from classic sci-fi to the romantic poets. t.s. eliot's \"east coker\" routinely makes me cry. i love post-colonial and diaspora literature. on my shelf there's everyone from walter benjamin to the marquis de sade to camille paglia to susan sontag to herman hesse to pablo neruda to neil gaiman to the brothers grimm. fave movies range from \"willa wonka's chocolate factory\" to \"la dolce vita.\" i'm a fan of old german expressionist films, french new wave, and the crazy stuff that werner herzog did with klaus kinski. \"vertigo\" is maybe the most romantic film i've ever seen, because i have a particular affinity for desperate, slightly sadistic love stories. \"cave of forgotten dreams\" was the last great film i saw in the theatre, because who doesn't love 3d explorations of deep time. sergei parajanov was better than andrei tarkovsky, only because he made perhaps the most primally, brutally, magically beautiful movie i've ever seen. i adore david lynch--his cinema and his music. i hate it when people say they have eclectic musical taste, but this is probably true for me. i'm into everything from old folk music to shoegazer to indie hip-hop to transdanubian swineherd ditties. i love live music and the performing arts. i'm an arts critic, and you'll probably be just as likely to see me with my monocle at the opera as you will be to see me hanging out with cutting-edge choreographers at an indie venue. i'm making a short series of films with a close friend about love, time, and other cosmic mysteries. i like images, art, and music that make me think and feel and know and wonder. what else can i say? food and wine rock. i'm a hedonist so i appreciate the finer things in life, although i can rough it with the rest and enjoy my asceticism in liberal doses. i used to fantasize about holing up in a cabin in the woods all by my lonesome for about a year, but i guess i just like people too much to get my hermit on in any serious way. books, wonderful friends, provocative and scintillating conversations, passion, art, more questions. and if i had to add a seventh, i harbor an undeniable ardor for underwear and spend a lot of time in high-end lingerie boutiques. the nature of self and identity, the architecture of a fine pair of stilettos, the taxonomy of human experience, prevailing injustices and how to address them effectively, the fine balance between solitude and intimacy, deep space and time, the dissolution of binary oppositions, weird organisms, malapropisms, puns, defeating the purpose, bringing back awkwardness and elevating it to a high art, the dual nature of cruelty and kindness, memories, love, mythology, dreams, the future of the future and civilization as we know it, what lies at the farthest reaches of the universe and the inherent quandaries of dark matter, the colonization of the interior world by harmful cultural memes, koans and other unsolvable riddles, the ever-present possibility of overcoming fear and human foibles, my next jetsetting adventure, the stupidity of religious fundamentalists and pollyanna new age types and cultural appropriators, imagoes, culling ideas for my next play, sexuality and its nuances. i've been accused of overthinking, but no way of thinking can be trusted without proof, and despite any pretenses of reservation and the contradictory quality of being extremely grounded and even-keeled, i have a fairly impulsive personality and like to soak up experiences as much as i like to ruminate on them. dancing the tango or ecstatically dancing somewhere (usually in my underwear), watching a movie, breaking bread with friends, meeting a writing deadline, adding a new corpse to my graveyard of gadgets, attempting brevity and failing. ...shall be divulged in private, preferably in a sultry lounge over a damn fine cocktail. ...you enjoy beautiful conundrums, you don't put the proverbial cart before the proverbial horse, you're a creator at heart, you have a wicked and often inappropriate sense of humor, you can make a mean classic cocktail, you dislike checklists of qualities and quantities and rely more often on your intuition and the gradual delicious unfurling of personal history that happens naturally, you're looking for a connection that feels like glowworms fornicating in a field of hands.\n",
      "i was born a while back, and i'm still alive, so i've got that going for me, which is nice. really, a self-summary? i don't know what the hell to put here... i'm a writer, i tend to be amusing, blah blah blah. oh, and i was a finalist in karaoke entertainer of the year in 2009. and i was a writer on spiderman 4 before it got canceled. yes, really.  currently a free-lance writer, a not-so-free-lance-drinker, and a lovely human being. i live in el cerrito, work the door at the mel-o-dee lounge on saturday nights, and bore people by telling them about my current screenplays. also, i wear a three piece suit on occasions that don't usually call for one. fucking everything. no, no, that's an exaggeration. i can't knit for the life of me. i have no idea. maybe they notice that i'm of average height? things get more interesting once people talk to me. these change all the fucking time, but whatever.  books: most things by denis lehane, donald \"hey, sometimes i write under the name richard stark\" westlake, terry pratchett and neil gaiman.

(am i being too literal here? in case i am, the next one won't be \"water\")  3) water (i lied.)  4) comedy. in some sort of form.  5) alcohol  6) a magic eight ball (literally, a magic eight ball, that i could somehow conjure stuff up that i've forgotten to put on this list.) fucking everything. singing karaoke. generally at the mel-o-dee. usually \"the devil went down to georgia\", or some johnny cash, or jonathan coulton. i have experience in making balloon animals. well, why the hell shouldn't you message me? unless you're racist. i wouldn't want to talk to a racist person. or a robot in disguise.\n",

      "right, here is where i sum up myself in a box. let's see...i like to think that i'm pretty easy going, can have a good time wherever i'm at. i love going out, all kinds of places--hole in the wall bars, clubs, whatever. i'll be that girl at the bar ordering like 20 jaeger bombs to force on my friends.  i also enjoy staying in, cooking dinner, watching movies and all that. i love food, perhaps a little too much. luckily i am also a big fan of exercise-- i've been a runner for about the last 14 years of my life and a gymnast before that. i'm the kind of person who goes a bit nuts if i take more than a few days off.  i don't really take myself too seriously, although i am a very focused, driven person. i'm very caring and affectionate and not crazy (is that something crazy people say?...hmmm). my family is very important to me. i may be one of the few individuals over the age of 21 that still goes on family vacations. well, i am a doctor. the other kind... i'm doing research in a lab at berkeley that studies how the frontal lobes function--basically seeing what happens when you replace the frontal lobe with bubble wrap. just kidding. actually we do some fancy neuroimaging and other fairly nerdy stuff that i usually avoid talking about unless people are really interested. i started out in college as a compsci major, hated it changed to neuroscience, but now i find myself spending the majority of my day writing code. it seems to be my destiny. there are some advantages to being a perpetual student though, such as being surrounded by extremely smart people, leaving work at 3 to go to pilates, working at home in my pajamas... running long distances, skiing, certain card games, being a smart ass, baking the best chocolate chip cookies ever, making strong drinks, eating large quantities of food, drawing trees, origami, taking shots, making shots (not the basketball kind...), remembering obscure movie quotes, charades i think the most common one is my ambiguous ethnicity...i'm half japanese, but i don't really look one way or the other (in my opinion). i get the question 'what are you?' a lot. right now i'm reading love in the time of cholera (in english). it's pretty good, i'll have to let you know if it qualifies for my 'favorite' list. i like anything by david sedaris. i've read a heartbreaking work of staggering genius like 20 times. it's hilarious. i am a big fan of science biographies. a habit i got into in grad school, but amongst my favorite are: surely you're joking mr. feynman, the double helix, genius.  let's see...movies. i absolutely love hot rod. who doesn't love to punch dance out their rage? oddly enough i enjoy sports movies (think remember the titans) even though i am not a huge sports fan (except for attending sporting events--beer and junk food? yay!). i'm in the will ferrel camp of course. in the last week i've been re-watching flight of the conchords and mr. show (the only dvds we had for several very long flights with my family). i forgot how hilariously awesome those shows are.  i like all music except most country (does old 97s count?). if you checked out my itunes collection you'd probably be very confused. after years of marathon training i've gotten used to running to very specific types of songs (think lady ga ga and rhianna...). when i'm just hanging out, doing work or drowning out the crazies on the bart i tend to listen to radiohead, broken social scene, modest mouse, yo la tengo, ugly casanova and whatever else my genius button pulls out of itunes (that thing is amazing!).  this box is not big enough for all of my favorite foods. cotton candy, red licorice (especially the one with the panda on the box), amy's burritos, hot sauce, blue cheese burgers, chicken wings, cheese stuffed olives, apple pie, mint chocolate chip ice cream, flaming hot cheetos, chips, salsa, omelets, ok that's probably enough for now...don't want to gross anyone out. i'm actually a pretty healthy person, i have just been blessed with a high metabolism so tend to eat whatever sounds good. 1. chocolate 2. friends 3. family 4. love 5. french fries (this goes hand in hand with #4) 6. sunshine robots, optimizing my bart commute, brains, my next meal, my next vacation usually out at a bar, or preparing to head that way. it's also just as likely that i'm over at a friend's place bbqing or eating mass amounts of chips and salsa and playing rock band. i once got playdough stuck up my nose when i was little and had to go to the er. how else are you supposed to be a walrus? you're looking for a partner in crime...\n",

      "***i really agree with this answer about dating (also, i love quora):  http://www.quora.com/dating-relationships/what-are-the-main-topics-you-should-never-ask-about-or-bring-up-on-a-first-date/answer/kai-peter-chang  ****  i tend to wander a lot, trying to acquire the experiences that will come to define me.  i value having conversations that you don't have during a typical superficial encounter. talking about things that make people a little uncomfortable or caught off guard tends to interest me. i guess i like the company of a nimble and brave mind. consciousness, trans-humanism, the utter chaos of the modern world, time travel, fiction, history and psychopharmacology would be but a fraction of my discussion(ramble)-triggers.  one of my greatest pleasures comes from making another person laugh. not just normal laughter, but true laughter that only happens when something is truly, uniquely funny. it's hard to get there with people sometimes, but i think humor is the gateway to the best human relationships. currently working for a financial/tech startup in san francisco and mostly enjoying it.  can't get enough of travelling and meeting interesting people.  ideally, i would love to be an international spy/thief where basically nobody really knows i'm a spy/thief, i'm just that great at it. i might already be one.  i hold out hope that there is some secret organization out there that would scout me out to maximize my potential income from such a venture. find me on twitter, shady organization. wait. such an organization wouldn't need to know how to find me would they? trippy. i like to push the boundaries of what i think i know about the world. everyone has a different perspective on things and i like to play devil's advocate sometimes when it seems like i haven't really looked at the other side of an issue. sometimes that additional unique perspective is all you need to beneficially question your view on the world.  having psychedelic experiences. getting drunk enough to dance. making mistakes and deriving a borderline excessive amount of lessons from them.  wondering how humanity (or myself) has progressed so far yet regressed so deeply.  overusing parenthesis.  writing way too much shit in this profile. height, my beard and my swag. freedom. 1984, hard boiled wonderland, the great gatsby  memento, oldboy, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, in the mood for love, mulholland drive, there will be blood, inception, drive, heat, the prestige, in the mood for love  interpol, mew, the arcade fire, the mars volta, blonde redhead, m.i.a., daft punk, simian mobile disco, boys noize, the twelves, radiohead, interpol, kanye west, holy ghost!, james murphy, a trak, no doubt (such fond memories of fifth grade), lykke li, animal collective, lots of other stuff.  i am pretty into breaking bad, mad men, twin peaks (i love david lynch), arrested development, and six feet under (best series finale ever). battlestar galactica was like my favorite show ever for a while but then they kind of messed things up in the 3rd/4th seasons. oh well.  i love ethnic food, i love trying new restaurants and random food stands and stuff (if you are a fan of senor sisig or fiveten burger, we will get along). pork belly for life. i live for crispy brussel sprouts. 1. loyalty 2. music 3. fiction 4. relationships with individuals that allow me to better myself 5. free will 6. passion life, death, the nature of consciousness  people and their motivations  the future  how to become a spy trying to catch an awesome show if i can. engaging in the official sport of san francisco, intoxication. gettin hyphy. urban spelunking. i've had at least 3 ego-deaths. i have felt the effects of racism and ignorance firsthand and can appreciate others who can fathom the idea of it. i have experienced an extraordinary amount of change in my life.  sometimes i think: most comedians do a great job of wishing racism away, but it's definitely there. if you know what it's like (or are interested in what it's like) to be an outsider.  you consider yourself independent.  if you want to pretend to be a spy/thief in the city.  you do silly things in the name of efficiency (like peeing while you brush your teeth. of course i use a clean hand to brush my teeth though.)  you like to talk about interesting stuff (almost anything can be interesting if the person can talk it up!). i like nerds/geeks (i used to be the biggest nerd ever, now it's just part of my secret identity).\n",
      "i often randomly break out into song. pr for the hospitality industry. procrastinating. my mom once told me i'm \"naturally lazy.\" i'm sure she meant it in a good way.  oh...and the running man. i do a kick ass running man (usually when songs of the poison by bbdv era pop up). i've had people compliment me on my eyebrows. kinda random, i know. tv: modern family, downton abbey, the killing, ncis, 90210 (don't judge), how i met your mother, always sunny, walking dead, breaking bad, dexter movies: annie hall, love actually, godfather, princess bride, neverending story, high fidelity, about a boy music: brett dennen, two door cinema club, pearl jam, jay z, justin timberlake, talib kweli, muse books: i'm going through a nordic crime thriller phase right now. read a few books by jo nesbo and am moving on to a swedish writer. other books i enjoy: disturbing memoirs (glass castles, lit, running with scissors), young adult (hunger games, twilight), intellectual (murakami - wind up bird chronicle), historical fiction (paris wife, loving frank), straight up fiction (vonnegut) oh, and let's not forget cookbooks. i probably own about 30 or 40 at least. good reading. food: anything and everything my family and friends (is it cheating to count this as one \"thing?\") my kindle television my knives (for cooking - i'm not some crazy weapon girl) sleep restaurants (my neighborhood thai place in particular) food. i went to culinary school and my job has me at restaurants almost every night of the week. tonight i hung out with troy polamalu (he's working with a restaurant i publicize) and last friday i was at dinner with my sister, mom, aunt and uncle at a another restaurant i work with. i don't know how private this is, but i watch an embarrassing amount of television. don't get me wrong, i enjoy obsessing over a good book as much as going out and being social, but i also spend a lot of time zoning out to some very good (and some very bad) programming. \"the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn, like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes 'awww!'\" - jack kerouac\n",
      "i wish i was 4. i am a scientist and i passionate about it and also happy that that pays my rent. i grew up at another west coast, that west coast being in the west of germany, close to the netherlands, yet i don't smoke much), but i love to live in oakland (and live here since 2004). i often play music (everything!) or hang out with friends or sometimes i go running. carrying stuff and helping my friends move to new apartments. the dimples and messy blond hair. my favorite book is \"the snouters\" and if that does not count as fiction, then it is \"so zartlich war syleyken\" by siegfried lenz and \"the slow man\" by j.m. coetzee. my favorite movies are (almost) all movies with hugh grant (it's true and i don't feel bad about it) and also really every movie directed by pedro almodovar (but i watch pretty much everything). the music i like often does not involve singing. at this moment i love \"zammuto\" and he sings a lot. my favorite foods are milk-chocolate and fish. love, guitars, music, friends, food, sleep. robots, weather, oceans, music, tiny houses and people. hm... i usually do one of the things i wrote down in the \"what i am doing with my life\" section, but most likely, i would be playing music (because it is friday?) i already mentioned hugh grant... but ok, i do like watching the show \"the bachelor\" with my friends. you would like to make an upright-bass out of an empty rogue keg or if you feel like it and if you don't mind me making silly mistakes when i speak english. for example i often say \"just in cases\" instead of \"just in case\" and have not quite mastered the use of the \"isn't it\" at the end of sentences.\" i am not sure i ever will.\n",

      "welcome to my profile, your search is now over.  i love mountain biking, sketching in nature, urban hikes, camping, climbing, yoga classes, getting really hungry and then eating, cyclocross, bike touring and spending time with friends doing those things (some of those things are not nearly as fun to do alone) what am i doing with my life? designing software, going to yoga a lot, riding bikes with friends, learning to cook new things, and planning some tropical travel with a bike ...maybe a surfboard. being corny. perseverance. i'm laughing at my own joke (or yours). reading: the onion, mcsweeney's.net cracks me up pretty regularly, unaccustomed earth, hunger games, yoga journal, bike magazine, alan o'bannons guide to backpacking, ...  music: iron and wine, band of horses, mgmt, the sounds, little dragon, the new pornographers, beach house, feist, nouvelle vauge, sean hayes, the rapture, the music they play in yoga classes, bon iver, gayngs, otis redding, chris isaak, dick dale, ..., ..., ...., and i'm a sucker for cover songs (i was at an iron & wine concert, they covered wild horses and i kinda melted.)  movies: the princess bride, run lola run, the departed, best in show, ... room with a view---yep, i'm a chick. i also enjoyed watching jack ass, watched it with my friend and it was hillarious, but then i saw some of it by myself and i hated it (just goes to show that who you're with changes everything).  tv: i don't have a tv or cable, but occasionally i'll get hooked on a tv show via netflix like friday night lights downton abbey the muppets made a big impression on me as a kid, i love those guys in the balcony, i love animal!!!, but my favorite is the swedish chef --> smrg di brg!!! i think i would watch more sports if i had a tv. i would probably watch a lot of pbs and probably rot my brain with reality tv (i'm glad i can't) i have these luxuries and i really appreciate them:  - my city bike --- it's so liberating to be able to get anywhere in san francisco on my bike in less time than muni could get me there and for free ... and it keeps me fit and energized to ride everywhere i go.  - pencil paper and watercolors --- i can draw anything i set my mind to.  - bike racing --- this has become a corner stone of my social life and i love it.  - the vast expanse of wild places around the bay area to hike and mountain bike (we are so lucky!). the only bad thing about these is if you sit home on a weekend you really have to feel guilty for not going someplace amazing.  - earthworms---we can't live without them.  - i'm also pretty happy about hot springs  and flowers, especially wildflowers  (i'm going to add to this)  my mountain bike hydration love activities, planning mountain bike rides.  food---i like to eat well, i enjoy cooking healthy food and i appreciate artfully prepared food very much.  travel  work (i get absorbed in work in a good way)  adopting a greyhound ..even though i enjoy not having the responsibility right now.  art and things i want to paint packing for an adventure, out with friends or having friends over for a feast. (this space intentionally left blank) you want to.  ideally: * you're compassionate and empathetic * you enjoy staying fit * you love children (as in, you don't dislike them) * you think funny sarcasm is funny * you're good with money (as in, not bad with it) * if you were my friend, you would set yourself up with me.\n",
      "i am the opposite of ocd- messy, unorganized, impulsive all meshed in with add. i am \"soft spoken\" but that's just because my voice doesn't seem to project very well. i have a difficult time not smiling... even when i'm upset i'll be laughing. i am tone deaf, which is my excuse for being the worse singer ever.  in general i try to make decisions without the consideration of fear- or for the adventure of making a mistake. obviously, that relatively immature rationalization cannot be applied to all aspects of my life- i am not so naiive to not examine the big picture on a consistant basis. i am incredibly rational, however, to me, living without regrets is far more important than submitting myself to confines of other people's rationalities.  in college i studied international economic development, basically- how to save the world. my heart still bleeds for humanity. but saving the world doesn't pay the bills... so for now, until i am ready to reconsider my life's passion, i work for a corporate financial advising company, managing 401k portfolios..i believe that's what one might call selling out. (yep among many other things i am a hypocrite).  i love to read, i get really obsessive about it, which sometimes hurts my social life... books are like mind movies.  i love puppies, i really really really want one really really really badly. i would be an excellent puppy mommy, my favorite bar is even dog friendly! my inner rational person says i don't have enough time to take care of a puppy. :( (this is important because if you have a dog i would be much more interested in you.) i live near alamo square, with 4 wonderful roommates. i am getting ready to take my series 7 and 63 to start making some real career advancing moves in the near future. aside from studying my brains out, i do whatever strikes my fancy.. i'm pretty freaking funny... once you digest my blunt sense of being. acting a fool on the dance floor... full of secret contest winning dance moves. making friends with strangers... strangers feel the need to talk to me, they think i care... i used to be a pretty sick snowboarder but i am a few seasons out of practice. making my room messy... i'm like a tornado pretending to listen... you might tell me a story 3 times before i realize i've heard it before. poor spelling... i sound things out, my pronunciation sucks. people always seem to describe me as demure when they first meet me... that would be a 100% inaccurate first impression. i like to read.  i like to watch movies, but only when i have absolutely nothing else to do.  current shows: always sunny, parks and rec, walking dead, game of thrones, true blood, bored to death, how to make it in america  food: i'm a pretty good cook... when i've been drinking. (i swear wine helps with creativity). when it comes to food i am pretty adventerous, i'll try anything at least 3 times. why 3? some people can't cook, they might screw something utterly otherwise fabulous up and other things you just aquire a taste for... so three is my magic number.  music, i listen to all sorts. my taste, however has generally been described a lack there of or unevolved. rest assured i will never volunteer my ipod at a party or in a long car ride. never is a strong word, there are a lot of things that i think would be sad not to have but i am pretty sure i wouldn't die without them. but i guess.. my sense of humor my sense of adventure my passport my friends my family i really like my ipad... a lot. time.. wasted, utilized, opportunitized, chanced  the opportunity cost sunday is the new friday i am terrified of zombies and dinosaurs  (i have vivid nightmares about them)  it actually has minor affects on my day to day life... my flat is neither zombie nor dinosaur proof. you want to be my personal chef you like random adventures you can hang with the gang\n",

help her \"look\" several years later she is engaged and despite threats i haven't deleted this thing...yet. i say that with all my online social media things truth be told but this the most cause it is all too strange to me  i have a love-hate relationship with these websites and filling out these profiles. right up there with the inane nature that a job interview these days. or maybe my own memoir or campaign speech. pick me pick me. remember me. ohh shiny.. so what the heck am i doing here? my masochistic tendencies mixed with being an adrenaline junkie, will always lead me to try try again.. maybe someone will break through the mind numbing monotony and disappointment.  and yes i picked this moniker after spider-man. she is my favorite though poison ivy/pamela isley, jessica rabbit would suffice.  i can play the role of the hermit and social butterfly. i love museums, movies, thrift stores, coffee, comic books/graphic novels, anime, pop culture, anything and everything music, tattoos, dive clubs/bars, fashion and so on. although these days i am more prone to being quiet and my idea of a good party has changed.  bay area born, raised and educated with ties to the peninsula, the city, the south bay as well as santa rosa. i currently live in foster city. i love the coast from pacifica to santa cruz the best. i also like roadtrips and can never get enough of reno/lake tahoe, los angeles, san diego to name a few.  been thinking more and more about moving, unless something concrete holds me here.  label me if you must, although i avoid it. silly okc recommended one user to me who rambled on and on about more or less not liking half of the things i do, which makes me question the validity of their so called matching system..  i have the other usual networking sites: twitter, myspace, facebook a couple blogs. if you want to follow or know me there if i get to know you can exchange  i would say i am moderate on things such as religion and politics and happily so. especially watching as the two sides these days are in a battle for extreme polarization. i try to love all people and give them a chance regardless of labels  i am quirky, quick-witted, and stylish i hate the \"body type\" question. i wish i could fill in the blank with slender/thin yet curvy. you can be both. i miss the days when cindy crawford was the it model. thanks to girls who want to use \"curvy\" as euphemism for being very overweight and skinny must connote the 90s waif look both terms leave some of screwed. i realize it a lot for the male mind to ingest. but trying to be honest.well sorry kinda sucks for rest of us. and screw \"average\" as i avoid that word like a politician avoid honesty. anyhoo i don't have a glossy phothog who can doctor my pictures and i have never mastered that angle shot myspace type girls did where they make themselves appear 40 pounds less than they are..so i am what i am.. trying to to take it day by day. sometimes second by second. it is a rat race and i have to try and stop it all at times. i am one of those people that does not want to be defined by their career. life is too short. did the school and college thing, and my over-achiever mentality wore me down. friends, family and memories are what it is all about. i am trying to translate a lot of the negative into positives in my life. i was laid off my job and took advantage of an opportunity to get some more training under my belt. i completed my certification in medical administrative assistant and am now thanks to a scholarship, i also got my medical clinical assisting credentials. it is not easy also letting go of people that hurt you and overhauling my life in that department. patient and supportive people that have gone through this and can help me would be cool as well. past two or so years have really been all at once frightening and empowering.  i work also as an independent contractor distributing and promoting various health

soft comforters, good conversation, music, journals, friends. and cause i don't like to follow rules i will throw a couple more out there: the aforementioned srirachia sauce as well as scented bath washes. hey i have to pull the girl card sometimes. of course irony, sarcasm, double entendres, cognitive dissonance , figurative language, cats, books and someone to hug me now and then and be nice or something oh please find the switch and calm my worried head. when am i not thinking. places i would like to visit or move to. where time has gone. new and creative recipes for peanut butter and sriracha sauce.  what i would do in the event of the zombie or vampire apocalypse. i vote morph into a robot and marry optimus prime if he is still single at that point. hey i would just be making best of a tough situation right?  satisfying my inner adrenaline junkie-roller coasters, the tattoos, etc. etc. yeah i have a thick skin. takes a lot.  i have a photographic memory + journal a great deal so obviously if i like it or not i spend a lot of time thinking period falling in love with ficticious characters. if i could actually find a real life spencer reid i could die happy. hell a weapon wielding fbi profiling genius that still has a child like quality and is cute is too much to ask right? oh well why must it be a friday? how about tuesday or perhaps thursday. i don't drink to excess any longer. i have several sets of friends those that either still do go out to clubs or those that are all domesticated. i am just trying to be the best me i can. whatever that means. responding to celebrities on twitter? matthew gray gubler and john fugelsang will eventually answer me back. i am an open book. but you will have to take the time to read between the lines. i sometimes make believe i hear background music as i go about my life. or that i have a narrator sort of like ferris bueller meets my so called life. i get caught lip syncing in stores or the car. the most embarassing of songs no less  i should put something like \"i have a glock and i am not afraid to use it\" cause bet that would make me internet cool? lol you can hold a conversation and make me laugh. i will gladly return the favor. yes right off the bat. hopefully be a bit silly and goofy yet smart and goal oriented. self proclaimed artists, actors or whatever else.  you have a comfortable balance of being grounded and motivated yet still try and take time to enjoy the world with a heart of a child. you're not so desperate and insecure about being single you click yes and message to nearly anything with a pulse in your geographical area. you have a musical recommendation or book for me. someone new to my area looking to swap \"cool places/cities to check out\" tips with  above all just be a decent person. i'm tired of false folks who play the \"nice\" card and are anything but :( confidence is great when tempered with an ounce of humility. think i care about how many others are chasing after you or padding your ego even more? think again.  i like people that are secure with the fact they are single. why is this such a stigma? yes this is a connecting site but i am not at all what you would call desperate or the typical female worrying about my clock ticking, etc. love yourself foremost. everyone else is here just to compliment the journey  please be functional. i want people to walk beside me, not forcing me into codependent or caretaker roles. you can have a heart of a child yet still be an adult. having people that lead a healthy non abusive lifestyle would be nice  i don't do mail order whatever it is. please stop writing me from outside the us sounding like some old school mail order bride/husband crap. annnnd if you actually read all this you get a cookie.. if you don't think i totally suck and am too strange in a bad way. although i might take that as a compliment. being too conformist is boring and if anything i am never bored.\n",
      "i gotta job and i don't live at my momma's house.  just moved out here btw.  i think going to the beach at 3 in the morning is much more enjoyable than the trip during the day.  i like beer, wine, and all that other fun stuff, but only in moderation of course. bars and clubs are alright, but i'd rather have a few drinks with some friends at a house or a movie theater or a super secret spot.  as much as i hate to admit it, i am a hopeless romantic. i'm not saying i'll fall in love with you, but i'll treat you right like my momma taught me.  i like concerts and plays, art shows and food, and festivals and scrabble.  i also like singing karaoke even though i sound like a chalkboard in a wood chipper on fire. sexy, i know. i like to write stuff. so i'm trying to become a journalist. but i need me some more learning. so i'm doing that while i'm doing a bunch of pushups and kegstands and stuff. don't wanna brag or anything, but i'm really good at tying my shoes, attempting handstands, and replying to text messages and calls in a reasonable amount of time. the first thing people usually notice about me is my swagger. jacked it from jay-z cause i heard he got it back. that and my glass eye. just kidding. i don't have a glass eye. so instead of naming everything, i'll say that i like hemmingway, palahnuik, wes anderson, fight club, purple rain, radiohead, neil young, and kanye. and everything in between. i don't discriminate against good taste. 1. the basic living essentials in my body. 2. my space heater. 3. a will to live. 4. soup. 5. optimism. 6. and family, duh! i spend a lot of time thinking about everything. i ain't no thought racist. i am an equal-opportunity thinker. on a typical friday night, i'm probably working. if i'm not, i'll find something to waste my time in an interesting way. the most private thing that i'll admit on here is that i'm a bit embarrassed that i'm on here. but you are too, probably. honestly, who have you told that you're using this service? message me if you're awesome.\n",
      "i tend to be very focused some of the time when first meeting. i am very passionate about a great deal of things and will talk about them for days. trying to take time to make community of creative types but center on building connections. this is my second account on this site as i saw significant changes in my outlook on life. i relish in the fact that i can take opportunities to rediscover myself.  the main reason i have come to like this site is the possibilities or potential to connect with someone. unless you live in the bay area or are planning to i have little time to develop or devote to someone i have no chance of seeing face to face unless they give some compelling reason. that would include but not limit things that pertain to what is on my profile here. i will quiz you on what is contained here.  i believe in connection. it is more important than anything and have a passion about it. i am extremely serious about this. if you want to ask me about this be prepared for a long response.  i have boundaries and abide by them.  the next thing that is very important is that i ignore people who do not have a match percentage at all and try to use this site for ads to their other web pages. take some time to fill out a few of the questions and profile. thanks.  i am intense, positive, and artistic i seem to have difficulty finding work that will not just give empty promises.  i am learning about reconnecting with myself and those who are of similar mind. of late i have considered what it means to be me in a greater sense. this is another reason i am on this and other sites. if you get a message or comment from me it is likely that i have found a connection point with you.  always looking for those who can understand what dreaming really is.  testing the limits of sane and safe behavior in the insane world we all have created.  watching my daughter drive everyone crazy.  finding the humor in just about everything about me.  enjoying the new connections in my life and living them to the fullest.  telling the people who are important to me that they are loved.  teaching my daughter how to recognize the limits that humans have to deal with on a regular basis.  coping with the moments as they come to me.  finishing the questions on this site and hoping that some good friends come out of it. i will also send a message to those that message me. being one with the universe. thinking on changes that are happening to my life. trying to see things as they really are not what they seem to be. listening for the little things that add up to the bigger ones. listening to the soul of things as i see it. trying to make connections with others. ...being in the right place. foot rubs. i also seem to have the ability hold people's attention without even trying sometimes. noticing people who notice things around them.getting the trust of complete strangers. touching the soul of others. pushing the limits of creativity. my eyes or my hair.  i have very intense eyes that people say look right through things. the other thing is that sometimes i seem really tall. the intensity is what usually gets most people. my intensity is shown in just about all of me. i welcome your messages to tell me what you see.  i occasionally color my hair to help thin it and keep the white at bay for the moment. my hair is longer now and still very thick. i have a love of hair that borders on a fetish. the longer the better. apparently the color of my hair is a very interesting topic for the moment. books: i have a deep love of just about anything by isaac asimov. robert heinlein is also up there. i have been reading science fictionsince 7 years old. ray bradbury is really good too. neil gaiman is probably my favorite now. i think i am starting to like terry brooks as well. i have a lot of books about the stuff that i am interested in and am trying to find a way to compose my own. philip pullman is on the list too. i just realized that c. s. lewis is also big on my reading list. i have a large collection of supernatural beings in my collection. yes even some old d&d novels are in there. everyone has their fluff to read. friday by robert a. heinlein, aisling by louise cooper, lion's blood by steven barnes, harry potter, dracula by bram stoker(unabridged), beowulf, and more to name later. the black dagger brotherhood books by j. r. ward are interesting.  movies: beowulf adapted by gaiman. the lord of the rings:rotk the extended version filled my nights with pondering.  music: i have always liked what is now called \"classic rock\" though when it comes to playing or composing i tend to be more blues oriented. i have a thing for percussion of all types. largely depends on what my mood is at the time. i have over a thousand cd's in my collection. i have just about every kind of music. what is there not to like save for the stuff that puts people down. as long as it takes you someplace it is very welcome. of late though i am starting to drift back into a darker mood to the music i listen to for the moment. my youtube account has a good representation. music means a lot to me. angus young, henry rollins, danny elfman, jimi hendrix, colin hays, joan jett, robert johnson, tenacious d, concrete blonde, howard jones, metallica, kmfdm, lycia, estampie, rob zombie comprise the beginning of the list of music in my head. at least for today. i really like all kinds of music. i don't think music has ever left my life and for that i am very thankful. it has the capacity to change the coldest heart and calm the troubled mind. i felt it early on in my soul. i belive music is a language to itself. i would defend music and its right to be played at any cost.  shows: i am into british science fiction shows. firefly. dr. who. red dwarf. hex. supernatural. smallville. painkiller jane. have not watched much else but am enjoying a lot of series on netflix very much. i had a weak spot for forever knight and special unit 2 when they first aired.  food: the one thing that i cannot even stomach is the combination of broccoli and cheese together. just about anything else will work. my weakness is all things made from blueberries. i just cannot pass up anything with them in it. the biggest bummer is when they took the blueberry newtons off the market. i found a substitute but they are not the same. and to think that blueberries are good for you. connections. love. music. serene moments. laughter. the universe. experience has shown me that there is no limit to the repercussion that can happen based on a single action. it takes but a moment to connect in a meaningful way.  it is as if by someone actually reading all of this rambling that they could glean something of my personality and find it within them to craft some witty response to what my mind was going through at this time. when all is said and done this sojourn that is life will be what it wanted to be. i am a man of many things.  it also seems very odd to me to consider writing a response to something that obviously by its phrasing at this writing wants a single response and not necessarily a discourse. yet for some reason rather than attempt to write a test for this site i continue to fill in characters to bring this character total to an acceptable place.  tell me what you make of this.i have seen where these interests have taken me. i want to see if a new leaf is in order. they began with acting, anime/cartoons/claymation, astral projection, ballet, bardic circles, bards, bass guitar, bdsm, belly dance, bisexuality, blues,

dimensional place.  i wear my heart on my sleeve. if you ask me i will find an answer.  in the end of things i think living one's life is best surmised by the connections that each person makes. you feel like it.  you have actually read the entire profile and can answer at least one question about me that i pose to you. i happen to be on the same time you are.  the next thing that is very important is that i delete people who do not have a match percentage at all and try to use this site for ads to their other web pages. take some time to fill out a few of the questions and profile. thanks.  i am not opposed to im on here but mostly am on this site at work so content is an issue. i like to keep my income in the black. i check my stalker list freqently so if you see me on yours it means that somehow you either had fate intervene on your behalf by being on mine or the quickmatch gave us a good rating.  this seems to be the default place where most users on this take the opportunity to air out the frustration of the kinds of people they do not want to message them. i don't mind a message if you realize that if you live outside the area of california that there is not a very likely chance that i will respond. i am not saying no but you had better have some very compelling reason to take the time to actually write something.\n",

      "lets see, i'm a nice, masculine, outgoing guy. i grew up on a crop farm, moved to la for a year, and then headed up north right after. i just recently moved to san francisco from marin after living there for 8 years. it's been quite an adjustment moving to the city, and the only complaint i have are those parking tickets that keep appearing on my windshield lol. i'm physically active enjoying working out and jogging almost everyday. i'm an outdoors kinda guy, so i try and catch some sun as much as possible whether it's by jogging down golden gate park, hiking, walking around the city or hanging out at dolores park on a sunny day. i love camping and my favorite sport has got to be snowboarding. career wise, i do real estate valuations for a few banks and sell real estate in marin, sf and the east bay. feel free to say hi. always trying to experience new things, see new places and meet great people along the way. also, working on my 5 year plan. making bad jokes and good ones too, keeping a conversation going, my work, spending money, driving fast cars, making spicy salsa and guacamole, building and fixing things, researching something i'm curious about, and enjoying life with my amazing friends and family. hmmm, i'd have to say my smile or my curly hair (if i let it grow out long enough). books: running with scissors, the da vinci code, memoria de mis putas tristes. looking for a new book to read, any recommendations?  movies: the bourne movie series, motorcycle diaries, y tu mama , labyrinth, up, peewee herman's big adventure (childhood movie), the hunger games. i also enjoy independent films and documentaries.  shows: battlestar galactica, modern family, family guy, south park, how i met your mother, frasier, seinfeld, mad men, the walking dead, law and order svu, million dollar listing, the voice, 30 rock, reno 911, aderson 360  music: crystal castles, the xx, chromeo, empire of the sun, diego garcia, robyn, collective soul, pink floyd, coldplay, gorillaz, sade, adele, babasonicos, moenia. i also like dance music, especially when working out (it pumps me up haha)  food: thai, i love mexican food: sopes, tacos dorados con papa, chilaquiles (yummmmmmmy). zachary's pizza, pupusas, peruvian cousine, and always down for in-n-out burger. i'm not a huge meat eater, but i absolutley love chicken and some seafood.  my favorite restaurants in sf are osha thai on valencia, dosa and san jalisco. in marin, it's sol food, and in oakland/berkeley it's a tie between zachary's pizza and cactus taqueria. iphone, car, gym, tapatio, queso fresco, cnn my next move. out for happy hour with friends, out for dinner or spending a quiet evening at home. like i'm really going to confess anything on here :) you don't take yourself too seriously, love the outdoors, enjoy social settings, and can hold a conversation. also a great smile doesn't hurt :)\n",
      "hi, my name is oliver, guys call me ollie, girls call me olive, guess it depends on your gender identity. i'm currently going to city college of san francisco studying humanities, history and computer science at the moment and most likely going into the cs field. i'm filipino and native mexican that dates back to the days of spanish colonization so you could say that i'm the product of western imperialism. i'm pretty big on the hipstergeekery so most likely i'll know something about your fandom. there are times where i wonder how many game hours i have devoted my life to, but i'm to lazy to go through all of the hard drives and memory cards to find out. going to [community] college and trying to figure out just exactly that. other than that, i'm trying to expand my horizons and just figure things out. i have so many aspirations yet so many limitations to overcome. making your points moot and your arguments invalid. probably the fact that i'm 5'2 and ain't growing any taller any time soon. eyes and hair have seem to stand out while i have people like my sense of style, some might say i even have sawg. swagswagswagswagswagswagswagswagswagswag... ok not really. music: if you wanna know what i've been listening to recently check out my last.fm http://last.fm/user/unreal31337  movies: enter the void, the man from nowhere, colma: the musical, lo, v for vendetta, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, noriko's dinner table, suicide club, high and low, happy together, oldboy, volver, but i'm a cheerleader, donnie darko, harold and maude, an education, and a lot more stored inside the mental file cabinet  books: dance dance dance, after dark, never let me go, catcher in the rye, leaving yesler, abraham lincoln: zombie hunter, bridge to terebithia, and god knows what else i have laying around  tv: i've been really into battlestar galactica and survivors recently, both reimagined series. other favorites are dead like me, firefly, weeds, shameless, skins, misfits, downton abbey, being human, the whole star trek series, adventure time, regular show, and himym. in no particular order: a phone, a book, music, shelter, a good laugh, a good friend, and a good lover. i think about the next logical step that will benefit from my outcome. at this moment i can't sleep so i've taken the time to update my ock profile to better fit my current self.  applying my thoughts, actions, situations and identity to various neo and post freudian theories and.  the technological singularity and the exponential growth in technology as known though moore's law. redditing like a redditor, tumbling like a tumblfag, and on occasion being a /soc/ialist. the size of my phallus is equivalent to that of the planck constant. if you're up at an ungodly hour of the night and have nothing else to do, if you just wanna talk, be friends, whatever, looking for a partner or no reason in particular. oh and here's my tumblr, be a creeper and send me anonymous messages, rebutting in witty, snarky remarks entertains me.\n",

      "ignore everything below this paragraph. just message me if you think i'm cute and/or would like to talk to me.  i decided to turn this into a freewrite exercise, which may lead to grammatical errors, lapses in judgement, etc., but i'm willing to take the risk. pretending to be a grownup. overthinking things and then being forced to finally act in the minimum amount of time with minimal effort. i'm not sure people ever do notice me. there is something unique about the way i look, but at the same time i feel like i could dissolve into any crowd. sometimes this fills me with a feeling of woe, but at other times i try to convince myself that, if i wanted to, i could become the ultimate spy! i wrote this really awesome thesis about how \"the neverending story\" changed my life. sadly it was lost in a tragic failure of ok cupid's database. some day i will write an essay about it. except it will be an essay about the essay about \"the neverending story\" and how i forgot to save it or something. kind of like tenacious d's \"tribute\". geez what a loaded question.  a friend of mine is going to ghana soon and i'm sure she's going to see some crazy shit like people who don't have enough food and water, yet i'm going to say something lame like \"i can't live without my wireless keyboard.\" what a joke.  there's nothing i can't live without, provided it's not a necessity for life (this is what is called a tautology :p). on the other hand i'm pretty used to the conveniences of modern life. if not for trader joe's i would probably starve.  i'm a pretty big fan of modern dentistry and could probably not do without it. this combined with good genetics and compulsive brushing have kept me in good health. things i need to get done. i'm losing my ability to be introspective. hopefully now that i finished school i can chill out a bit. friday night i usually chill out at home and watch t.v. shows on the internets or play video games. saturday night is the more likely time for me to go out. i'll admit just about anything, except if i'm wrong, you're right, and i know you know i'm wrong, and it frustrates you but not enough to really make you angry, but it flusters you enough to make your cheeks puffy, red and cute ;)  i'm not at all on board with this mustache meme. mustaches are not funny. certain mustaches command great respect, however. you have any cute pets. especially puppy dogs. even more especially a labrador retriever, corgi, or husky. fuck it, if you have any pet at all i can cuddle, message me a.s.a.p.  also message me if you think i can't keep up with you. maybe i can't, but i will try. darn it, i will probably surprise you.\n",

as opposed to carrying this \"warring\" inside, addictions, etc to our friends, partners, community ).  until or unless the individuals for this family \"show up\", i am as always, open to what is true (and may be even better than my imagination).  i don't believe love is what we are conditioned to believe. to me love is not desire (though desire is nice), attraction - chemical or otherwise (though attraction can be nice), addiction, avoidance of loneliness, possession, finding someone so we are not \"alone\" when we are old, or conditional. love is a vibration, an unconditional positive regard, not dependent on what we get back. if we allow the things that are not love run us, we may not do what is best for ourselves or for others. and we may never wake up. it feels right. your guides tell you to. you are open to what you may receive. you are open to your growth. you like and are good at intimacy. you are more interested in real people than lists and fantasies of people. you don't spend a lot of your time in conflict with others. you are open to what the world has to offer you as opposed to conditions you make on whether you are open to experience. you are capable of growing. you have an open heart or your heart is opening. you appreciate the simple and see the complexity of life. you eschew black and white thinking. you experience the connectedness of all things. you can share what your sun (zodiac) sign is with me (if it's not public in your profile) for dating i'm especially interested in people who are able to love more than one, and or, open to their partner loving more than one person (ie polyamory, poly, non-monogamous, or open relationship). while in the more than friends arena, i am focused more on dating currently, when in serious relationship, i do look for people who are able to be committed. that to me is not a promise of a certain number of years in the future ie 50 years (a false promise to protect anothers or one's own fears-no one can know what the truth will be 20 years in the future), but committed to the relationship, committed to their truth, and to being truthful - all in a poly relationship. (the number of people in the relationship do not determine the qualities or abilities of the people in the relationship, nor the baggage they bring from growing up in a messed up society. one can do poly or mono relationship in equally unhealthy or unrewarding fashion. eventually, in the long term, my ideal is to live in a poly family, ie multi-adult (three or more person) family as opposed to dyadic (2 person) family.  warning: any institutions or individuals using this site or any of its associated sites for studies or projects-you do not have permission to use any of my profile or pictures in any form or forum both current and future. if you have or do, it will be considered a violation of my privacy and will be subject to legal ramifications. it is recommended that other members post a similar notice.\n",

      "entj in search of more -- more laughter, more fun, more soulful conversations, more road trips, more international experiences, more adventures in dining, more thoughtful conversation about life, philosophy, and the wonders of the world.  i'm curious about the world around me, about the world beyond this one. i want to know about others, about what makes people tick, and what possesses people do to the darndest things... and what makes me do/say/think the same dumb stuff. i wonder about how ingredients combine to create amazing flavors, textures, and aromas. i have a general curiosity about everything... including about what goes on in my dog's brain.  i'm ashamed to admit i've traveled more abroad than i have domestically. i have a fascination with mcgyver-like skills and which i could be as creative as he. i burn the candle at both ends. i have lived a full life thus far, and yet feel like i've just started living.  i love my friends, my family, my dog. i'm physically active, involved with my community, and always looking for someone to share life's adventures with. although i work in a pretty intense field, i'm always looking for fun ways to relieve the stress and leave work behind. could you be my partner in adventure? i'm making my little corner of the world (and another 13 hours ahead) hopefully a little brighter! right now, i'm trying to slow down (just a little) to meet all the interesting people i've been too rushed to get to know. being a friend, a problem solver, a host, and sharing a meal with friends. i had no idea until i asked my friends: my smile, my warmth, my hospitality, down-to-earth personality movies -- i enjoy foreigns, indies, dramas, comedies, romance, chic flix, and occasionally a good action thriller. shows -- broadway & theater if i could afford it. so i settle for dramas, some silly comedies, and if i had cable, home, history & science stuff. food -- love all kinds! it's my drug of choice (or is that wine that is?). i especially love noodles & dumplings of all kinds. music -- listening to folk/rock, country rock, some country, classical (occasionally i crank up opera while cleaning), jazz, blues, world, tango.... not so much on the heavy metal, punk, electronic/trance, hiphip. love to dance to big band/swing, zydeco, and salsa. integrity, humor, curiosity... npr... an occasional massage (the kind that makes you melt) and a really nice glass of red wine (the kind that makes you want to take a bath in it) silly things... like why eucalyptus tree trunks spiral and twist as they go up? and why always in the same direction? and do they twist in the opposite direction in the southern hemisphere? it varies. sometimes i'm winding down from a week with a glass of wine, delicious food, good conversation, and laughter. sometimes its going for dinner, a movie, or a show. and sometimes, it's hanging out at home with the dog and a movie on the tube. requires that you get to know me before i disclose! your mother raised you to be a gentleman you're not intimidated by confidence you have compassion for others you enjoy making breakfast you just want to say hello\n",
      "where to start! i'm random, i'm quirky, and over all just a dork. i smoke cigarettes and i rarely drink anything besides water.  i consider myself to be very artistic. i draw, paint, sculpt, knit, the list goes on. i just like to be creative. i also love animals. i have two small dogs and they are my world. if i could have more animals i would! i'm a bit of a homebody. i don't go out very much, and i'm not into busy places with big crowds. also not really into partying or that sort of thing either. i love the snow and the mountains. i enjoy skiing and eventually want to learn how to snowboard too. i love places like tahoe and yosemity. i also love the beach. when i'm at home i love playing the video games. mainly world of warcraft and league of legends (if you know anything about either of those games huge bonus points!) also recently got really into diablo iii  i'm just looking to meet some new people. i'm a little iffy about sites like this but i figured i would give it a shot. i'm definitely very shy when it comes to meeting new people, but once i feel comfortable with someone i warm up quickly. i'm not working at the moment but financially independent i live with two room mates and my dogs. i love art and helping both people an animals. i used to work as a counselor for a non profit agency. i enjoy working with either animals, art and or helping people such as counseling. ideally i would like to eventually have a career in the art field. art is just something i've always been good at and just really enjoy doing.  recently i got into trying to get healthier and in better shape. working out is amazing and i love the way it makes me feel. being a good friend. listening to people and helping with problems. i'm a good problem solver. i love art of all kinds from drawing to painting to ceramics to just general arts and crafts. i also play a pretty good at world of warcraft. currently raiding with a top 50 us guild. although i don't know if most people even know what raiding is xd my eyes, and my quirky personality. oh man i have so many i can't list them all. if you contact me though i can tell you. mainly i'm open to read any book that looks good. when i open a good book i can't put it down. with music i listen to a little bit of everything, but mainly rock. movies my favorite of all time are the star wars movies, but i'll always watch any movie, because often times it's the movies that i'm not all that interested in watching that turn out to be some of my favorites. my all time favorite tv show is the golden girls. i know it's pretty silly but i just love that show. i've seen every episode so many times but i still love to watch it! other than that i watch a lot of the science channel and the travel channel and i use to watch a lot of the discovery health channel till they got rid of it. now as for foods. i love mexican food. especially enchiladas. yum! i also love games. i play a lot of world of warcraft, league of legends and diablo iii. my friends, my family, my dogs, my computer, water, and my car so many things. my mind is always running full speed. so i can be thinking about anything to what i'm gonna do in the next 5 min to what i'm gonna do in the next 10 years lol. it goes all over the place. actually sometimes i wish i could get it to slow down. lately i think a lot about ways to improve my life. i would love to increase my social circle and just get myself out there a bit more. also working on getting in better shape. probably on the computer talking to friends and or playing world of warcraft, league of legends or diablo iii. yup i'm a nerd. i have a pretty boring life. you love random and quirky humor, or are also into games :d\n",

      "seriously, friendship only; maybe i'm in the wrong place looking for it, but all the other venues are worse. in all honesty, i, of course, would like friendship with those who are easy on the eyes, but i am far more concerned with how i connect with people than how they look. i prefer to be around tall guys (my brothers are both 6'5\") as i am not little and don't always want to feel like a big giant.  here's the problem...some of the best friendships i've had in my life have been with males (even if our ways of viewing things were totally different). now, 98% of my friends are females who are married with children. it's partly because those are the people who've shown themselves to be genuine, dependable friends. i can say that almost all my single male friends are in other countries.  i love traveling and relaxing. i've been to about 19 countries. if i could find an actual career as a beach bum, i would do it. i think winter weather is beautiful to look at, but not to be in. i am a summer baby and need my vitamin d.  born an oakland raiders' fan, i went to my 1st game at 3-months-old and even made it to their last super bowl. most here can't handle it, but can't stand usc or the lakers.  i love romance languages and everything italian. i've studied french, spanish, italian and arabic. i've lived in france, italy and jordan, but am infinitely connected to the bay.  somewhat of a side note: i am not looking to be impressed, but find myself fairly impressed when people use \"who\" instead of \"that\" when referring to people . people who take the time to use (mostly) correct spelling and employ punctuation, when not sending text messages, also make me pretty excited.  i used to ride a motorcycle as my one and only means of transportation but i haven't been back on it, thanks to an accident in october '09. it brought joy to my day on a daily and i hope to be able to again one day. the bright side of it was i ended up getting the t-bird i've wanted for years.  my close friends and all of their children make my life worthwhile, but when i don't see them (which is most of the time, given the distance), i settle for movies, tv, cooking, a day at the beach when i can get it and [attempting] cleaning. my ankle was pretty badly injured in my accident and i have severe and painful arthritis now. sadly i do not do things i used to love doing.  i consider myself to be straight-forward and appreciate the same. i don't think it takes a lot to be both honest and considerate with others. i realize now that i may come off as somewhat superficial, but i really am just a scatterbrain. i am not a fashionista whose hair and make-up are always on point. in fact, i don't really wear make-up and my hair can be a wild mane. (is that really important if you're truly seeking a friendship from me though?) i do care about things, and have strong opinions on many subjects, but i am far more uninformed and uninvolved than i should be. it is because i'm just not together enough to govern anything but my own thoughts and life. on the other hand, i believe that i am a caring, thoughtful individual who's often riddled by compassion. i used to be a really affectionate person, but i've spent so much time away for those with whom i'm really comfortable, i don't know if i still have that in me. i'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. i haven't been to work since october 2009 and don't know what will happen to me once i am no longer eligible for disability (i may need yet another surgery). my days still zip by, though i can hardly think of anything i've managed to get done. my desires are simple at this point. i just want a house of my own and stability, without yielding to boredom and monotony. honing in on things with sunflowers on them, breaking electronic devices, fitting many things into compact spaces, being at ease with not fitting myself into anything (figuratively), providing friends with a realistic perspective and making [important-to-me] people feel special on their birthdays. i've found that most people's first impressions of me tend to be completely off-base, be they good or bad. although not the wordiest in my family, i do talk/write/communicate a lot. people tend to notice that. i am fairly aliterate (def: a person who is able to read but rarely chooses to do so), but i wish i read more.  the child who resides in me loves finding nemo and the lion king. i also like goonies, better off dead and what about bob. i love the joy luck club. i also like any given sunday, cinema paradiso, most movies which play with time, many of kevin smith's films, juice, the kill bills, just to name a few...  i like a lot of different music, but could afford to be exposed to a lot more. i hope any friends i make introduce me to new things.  i can be very \"healthy\" in my eating, but not so much in the last couple of years since it's harder for me to cook than it used to be. i haven't eaten red meat or pork in almost 25 years. on days when i am not giving up anything like, i'd eat cuban, peruvian, thai or japanese first, and have a deli sandwich with peppered turkey and smoked gouda from genova's (in the bay area). i love summer fruit (excluding melons). i think i have a minor blueberry addiction. other than certain meats, there are few things i don't like to eat. insulin sleep summer sound lions and sunflowers water (to drink, to shower in, to swim in and to look at) what the rhyme and reason is in life, where life will take me and what my great accomplishment will be before i leave this earth. the same things i think about during the rest of the week, since i don't go to work. i love to sing (all the time), but am sure people wish i wouldn't. you're a patient person, you're looking for friendship, your favorite activities don't include going on hikes and spending every spare moment at the gym and you're somewhere in my age range (give or take 6 years). please be a straightforward and honest person. if you find you have little in common with someone, be courteous enough to say that instead of disappearing.  or, contact me just because you have firsthand knowledge of ankle fusion surgery and its results or alternate resolutions for a blown ankle joint. i'd like to hear any and everything i can from anyone who has any information about it.\n",

      "i am a ninja by night fall and a ninja in disguise by day...i am who i am...take it or leave it i am on a new adventure in my life. i am orginally from the bay area but have been living in atlanta for the last 12 years, now i am back in california looking to start a business and figure some $hit out. i am a mom of a awesome 3 year old, and no i'm not saying awesome because she is a product me (though that does help) its simply because she is loving, sweet, intelligent, and curious about life in a way most three year olds simply are not. everything i put my mind to...talking (i'm good at all kinds of chit chatting, especially talking smack), listening, being a good friend, making people laugh, and cooking some good grub... my smile...also, i always get compliments about my hair books: i'm not as good at reading books right now but working on it. currently reading \"an open heart\" by the dalai lama...but love anything that teaches me things about life, myself and others.  movies: i'm a movie fanatic. i could just stay home all day on the couch watching movies. but love indie, foreign, comedies and quirky movies. also kung fu movies i love, but i hate horror flicks...  shows: i'm not a real tv person, most stuff is either cartoons with my daughter or reality shows...definitely a weakness for reality shows. it makes my life look so normal...  music: i like everything except country. i enjoy all music and learning about new groups or musicians, and have probably heard of everything in the exception of local bands/music.  food: i eat just about everything and will try anything once. i'm on a more veggie and fruit diet, and try to stick with fish and poultry. but overall, i am a food connoisseur trying to educate my palate. if you can cook for me you got extra points, nothing more sexy than a man who knows his way around kitchen. family/friends, health, my mind, laughter, music, sunshine being able to relax my mind, spending time with my daughter and clearing out all the negative and living in the positive. i'm always looking for ways to better myself and educate myself. being an adult is an ongoing process... i do whatever i feel like doing whether it be: hanging out playing with my daughter, hanging out drinking good wine with good friends or just kicking back relaxing and watching a good movie. i love men in uniforms. you can tell me what the hell short term dating means!! or simply if you are a creative, artistic, music loving, ambitious guy who is honest, loves kids and is a great cook or willing to become one!!\n",
      "i am a mellow but active person. i am intrigued by new experiences and am willing to do most anything once. i have been on 3 different continents and would love to return to any or see the others equally.  i am probably what most would consider to be a tinkerer. basically all my hobbies have involved something with my hands. i enjoy the puzzles mechanical things present. that said, i am equally interested in the puzzle of humanity, in both individual and global senses. i love to listen/people watch and observe the multitude of different personalities and actions humans possess. taking advantage of new experiences.  more specifically, working working as an emt in order to be a paramedic. fixing things, at least i try to be. i own several motorcycles, in various states of \"repair\", but i also have a degree in psychology. i don't claim that this means i have all the answers, but the study of people is something i spent many years engaged in, and it is something that truly gets the ole' hamster wheel spinning. my long luscious locks of hair? (...see pic). honestly, i have never had anyone comment regularly on something they notice about me. it usually depends on the situation and person who is observing. i have been called loud and outspoken as well as quiet and reserved. i would like to think i have an adaptable personality, and can fit in however i deem necessary in many situations. for the more superficial observations, i have received lots of compliments referencing my eyes, so perhaps they are noticeable? i have a visual memory. this was a definite advantage in high school, where i could basically memorize what the text book pages looked like, but it is a detriment when it comes to remembering things like names... of well... anything. this doesn't mean i don't have different tastes and likes/dislikes in regards to 3 of these topics, but i am unable to just spit out a list of things i like and don't.  i was a musician, and will listen to pretty much anything but country music. it isn't the tunes so much that get me, but the accents/subjects of country. for movies, i suppose i am a \"dude\". i would rather not watch \"chick flicks\", other than stardust (yay remembered one! took a while though...). books - books and i never had a very good relationship, sort of like math. that said, i am not adverse to, and would actually welcome someone who could learn me in the literary ways... think of me as a blank slate ;)  food is something i am fond of :) i will eat a burrito pretty much any time, but not from just anywhere. i suppose sf has spoiled me. there are too many good mexican places to settle for bad ones. after one of my recent trips, i gained an affinity for indian food, but am much less learned on good indian stops. sushi is another food i love. i suppose food mirrors my tastes in music, pretty much everything :) first and foremost, my friends. humans are social creatures and in order to be mentally healthy, social interactions are mandatory.  although i am not super close with my family, they have supported me my entire life, and have done their best to raise a decent, well-rounded human being.  next would probably be my bikes. admittedly, i probably don't need as many as i have, but i am finally coming to the realization that just because something is a good deal doesn't mean i should acquire it. i am working on shrinking the stable, but i love riding them whenever i can, and i love wrenching on them or my car. finishing a project, be it minor or massive, gives a wonderful feeling of accomplishment.  thats probably the end of meaningful things, rest would be the internet (thats probably somewhat obvious), my phone, and my bed. the future most recently usually hanging out with my friends. i was a badass band geek :) you are interested in showing me what you love and what makes you tick. i like sharing new experiences with people.\n",

(plus technical books.)  movies: i'm a little over half-way through the list \"1001 movies you must see before you die\".  music: classical, metal, opera, electronic, punk, indie, country, pop, jazz, hip hop, etc. it doesn't matter the genre, only the quality.  food: sushi, but i'm not picky. trick question. how to build a rocket to the moon. fighting petty-crime in a latex suit. i'm batman. there are no ifs, you just should.\n",

      "i am healthy and friendly, and real.  i'm now 6 decades (real age) of mostly non-decadence (everything in moderation?), originally a new englander (ct), but a thorough californian, having been here since '73. i have lived, mostly, a qualitative than a quantitative life. i am a lifelong student, always learning, and \"graduation is upon termination\" (or \"expiration\"), (that's a personal philosophy, so i demand honorable mention whenever you use the term, and royalties if you plan to publish it for profit). mostly a natural foodie, almost exclusively organic, very healthy and active, fitness club member, but i get most of my exercise in the work i do and enjoy. i practiced yoga before i even knew what yoga was, and i can still touch my toes...... with my palms. i'm loving, romantic, and passionate about virtually everything i do, and very sensual as my phonetically spelled handle indicates.  i've enjoyed canoeing, and camping, and would like to try kayaking and especially sculling, someday. i love to walk and hike in nature, and enjoy hot springs. i like to take trips occasionally on my honda, and have ridden it to so. cal. a couple of times, and along the coast and the backroads of ca, and in new england, too. i am not a honcho biker by any means though. it is an expedient, affordable means of transport, as well as fun, too, a tool more than a toy, and it helps me to keep my wits about me, as i age, and i first learned to ride at age 41. i have never had an accident on it, and have had plenty of experience riding a passenger (maybe you, too). i don't much care to watch sports, and previously always preferred to participate.  drinking alcoholic beverages is minimal to no part of my life, and believe it or not, i'm not much of a beer drinker. i don't like the taste of hops even when i grew it as an ornamental and herbal remedy years ago. my favorite is pilsner, no hops, but still drink it minimally. mostly a coffee drinker, and yes, organically grown and fair trade, (it's only fair), and herbal teas.  i am a handyman as well as an organic gardener, and tinkerer and love architecture and design. i have been a cabbie in sf, worked at the sf flower market and managed a small houseplant nursery, been a professional maintenance gardener/landscaper, and somewhat of a 'jack of all trades', and worked in the architectural salvage business for almost 2 decades, so we could enjoy garage sales, and flea markets together, but it's the real salvage companies that i mostly patronize. i almost single handedly remodeled and staged my home which i sold back in '08 & made it so beautiful that it sold in spite of the 'meltdown', and made a custom built studio that i built for myself, which was a bit eclectic, but comfortable, and was almost entirely comprised of sound used materials, some creatively used, and i even made a slate lined shower, formerly chalkboards, i personally removed years ago, from a local east bay high school, when they were real stone. i'm, also, both an amateur photographer and musician (guitar, electric, mostly).  summary for you ladies: he likes to work on a home, tends not to waste a lot of time watching sports, and doesn't drink beer much, no tobacco, and 'needs' no 'up in smoke', and likes a kiss and a cuddle when he comes home from work or even while working at home, instead of a 'brewski'. a 'youski' instead of a 'brewski' (forgive me, i'm part polish) let's get distracted together while working on 'our' home work, sometime? wink, wink. lq (lq=laughing quietly; alternative to lol)  i am a humanist, but not totally, i do set things straight if the need arrives, an amateur psychologist (maybe, by now, actually a professional. must one be paid, to be a pro?), liberal progressive and social democrat, and like to talk to/debate any thinking person.  i am earth conscious, an avid recycler and re-user, but not a hoarder, a conservationist, naturist and naturalist, and pet and wildlife friendly, too. i even like kids.... who are well behaved, relatively speaking.  i believe that if there really is/was a god that created this heaven upon which we live, (and this planet is, or was, now, heaven), then shouldn't we figure that that god would want us to discover and put in practice how to replete and sustain it's glorious gifts to us, rather than just extract, pillage, and eliminate our own existence in a self-blinded, though most selfishly profitable process?  i think for myself more than i read about others thoughts, mostly due to dyslexia, but not opposed to an author's take on life, necessarily. my personal reference library, almost entirely non-fiction, though, is extensive and includes a myriad of books on horticulture/gardening/herbalism, the trades, diy, mother earth news, health/nutrition/bodywork, the norton anthology of english lit., the oxford shakespeare, and bucky fuller's synergy, just to name a few. i, mostly regularly, read blogs from those who i respect to be truthful and honest on alternative real news web media, and love \"democracy now!\"; bobby jr., 'pap' and sam seder of \"ring of fire\"; keith olbermann (welcome back and goodbye again, \"countdown\"!); and bob kincaid & rick smith of the \"head on radio network\" (the horn), also dig rachel maddow, and 'peter b' collins from our left coast.  i am an eager informal student on nutrition and health, and consciousness more than spirituality, (consciousness is probably the height of spirituality. yes/no? wanna' debate it) usually through interviews with actual researchers on the \"one radio network\", and \"new dimensions\" i-radio, and even enjoy 'the youngsters' from \"new dissident radio\", and sometimes even enjoy listening to classic radio programs.  i enjoy viewing/listening to any well performed music and love: stevie 'guitar' miller, jeff beck, the late mike bloomfield and electric flag, quicksilver messenger service (w/ the late great john cipollina), santana (love the latin beat, and someday to play congas), moody blues, hendrix, clapton, eagles, doobies, beatles, and most of the other classic rock bands, but also chet atkins, mark knopfler, django, buddy holly, roy orbison, brian setzer, the everly bros., the ramones, johnny and edgar winters, los lobos, los lonely boys, the ventures, & classic r&b and sweet soul music, otis redding, the four tops, temptations, james brown, & so many more. having had a nice respite from all the remodeling work done on my former home of over 15 years and now am enjoying the rewards of helping others with their homes again, learning and achieving greater health & looking to add new friends, & lover(s). spending too much time on the internet. body exercise is becoming supplanted by finger (keyboard) exercises. must cease soon, or will lose my sense of humor, and then maybe the other 5 things listed below that i can't live without. lq working with my hands (and yes, my mind too; my hands wouldn't go anywhere w/o it, especially if my eyes couldn't see where my hands were going), and kissing. if i'm taking my helmet off at the time, then it's probably that i am too old looking to be riding a big sport bike. but then, it is a practical honda, not a harley. no midlife crisis, here. movies are : docs., indies, foreign, some domestic, directors &/or actors and just a few favorite movies. truffaut: small change, fahrenheit 451 zeffirelli: brother sun, sister moon, (the best) romeo and juliet fellini: la strada, juliet of the spirits, the clowns, amarcord wertmuller: swept away, seven beauties ken russell: tommy, the devils jadorowski: el topo, the holy mountain sergio leone: the 'dollars' trilogy, once upon a time-in the west & -in america, woody allen: what's up tiger lily?, bananas, sleeper, radio days, take the money and run, broadway danny rose mel brooks: the producers, blazing saddles, young frankenstein clint eastwood: pale rider, the no name cowboy trilogy(described differently above), & \"go ahead,....... make my day\" please! lq sean penn: at close range, sweet and lowdown, milk tim roth: the legend of 1900, rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead, invincible michael moore: roger and me, fahrenheit 9/11, capitalism  the king of hearts, & bram stoker's dracula, the princess bride, big night  pbs mystery series: agatha christie's \"hercule poirot\"( especially for the great art deco settings from that era), and the late and quintessential jeremy brett version of \"sherlock holmes\", and sir michael kitchen in \"foyle's war\"(i have a crush on honeysuckle weeks. what a darling!); \"i, claudius\" and the \"nature\" series and many others.  and even though i thoroughly enjoyed star wars, and still like to watch reruns occasionally and have loved the star trek series and movies, especially with patrick stewart, can't lose with a shakespearean trained actor, my favorite is dune (& stewart acted in that one, too). and in frank herbert's immortal words, in regard to the 'occupy' movement, \"the sleeper has awakened\".  food: raw, but not fanatical about it. i do love raw milk. i like to eat the healthiest food at home (us eating together, would be the ideal) most of the time, and love prawns, and new england style clam chowder, but never have liked fish (and likely, now, never eating from the sea again. drat, double drat even). i eat beef, occasionally raw, but all-grass fed. i enjoy truly good pizza, ethnic restaurants for fun, and anything not highly processed, but takes some skill to prepare, on occasion. safe nourishing nutritional organically grown food and drink. both psychological & physiological health created by the above food. my senses/sensuality created by the above health. gardens/flowers, especially those fragrant augmenting my senses. passion for all beneficial persons, places, and things. humor or humour ('our humor', together) for additional health. all sorts of things. i analyze most/all things in order to obtain greater understanding and knowledge. home watching \"mystery\" on pbs or listening to internet radio. working on a project. at a movie and/or dinner with a friend. or i'd be on a date with you, but we haven't met yet. so what are you waiting for? i have a crush on amy goodman, and i respect and honor her and elizabeth warren for their life's work and if you do, too, then we have something in common, already. i'm somebody you'd like to know and know how sensual/sexy balding guys are.  you are interested in the above categories of relationships, and are willing to write back responsibly, and meet sooner than later. 'time's-a-wasting', and you're not getting any younger waiting for that possibly nonexistent 'optimal' man.  \"why wait any longer, for the one you love,... when he's standin',.... in front of you?\" who wrote that?  and if you are a wholly emotionally, physically, and psychologically available straight or bisexual woman. even 'tomboys', too, sometimes.  i prefer women closer to my age, but i'm not an agist, so please don't be one yourself, for you younger and older ladies. we really do need to join together, regardless of our ages.  and sober as well, minimal drinking preferred, and as for the funny stuff (\"dave's not here, man.\" lq), it's best if you have a medical prescription for it, since it's, unfortunately, still illegal, please and thank you. and we can discuss this issue further in private.  i haven't chosen the relationship category, 'casual sex', because i prefer to have a friendship, as well, with any woman who finds sex without a full relationship appealing and/or sometimes a necessity due to certain circumstances, but i'd like to know that upfront, please.  i have always sought monogamous relationships, and still do, but i feel that i am more than mature enough to have a poly type relationship, preferably committed and long term, but as stated above, can only occur with full honesty. remember bucky fuller's term, 'synergy', the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts. individually, we are not as omnipotent as we could be collectively. a mutually beneficial reason to get, be, and stay together.  so then, let's 'occupy each other!'. 'oeo!', as well as 'ows!'  so, i'm waiting lady(ies), patiently, but please don't waste much time, as i stated, we're not getting any younger, as far as i can tell, anyway. lq grazie!\n",

      "warm, sloppy, enthusiastic, verbal, bicultural, non-judgmental, curious, searching, attentive, fast, obscene. values education, distrusts power. very interested in limits. too old to suffer fools. quick to love but not looking too hard for it at the moment. nonstop hilarity, hint of anxiety. wordplay. talking to strangers. sweating outdoors for long periods of time. writing bluegrass songs. writing about my experiences. biking to work. making my grandma laugh. making other people try new things. since i am tempted to say sculpted musculature, i guess the correct answer is narcissism/body dysmorphia? books. sensitive, honest observers, wry, intelligent satirists with a touch of dread, or off-the-wall stylists. anything twee, indie, or too hip makes me want to light myself on fire. i have literally thrown books across the room in disgust because of the writing.  music. anything and everything so long as it is produced well enough to discern the instrumentation. i'd have sex with freddie mercury's voice.  food. vegetarian for a decade, now a shameless omnivore with a weakness for pork buns.  movies. take me to see one. it's been too long. besides the obvious ones (friends, family, and my border collie mutt), fitness, kindness, and weirdness. how to improve myself. still at work. trying a new restaurant (or three) with friends. attending somebody's fundraiser for something. resting for sweaty outdoors time on saturday morning. two things. i prefer talking with our faces almost touching. and i doubt things will work if you don't love language as much as i do. you: agree that the brain is the sexiest organ; think the same words have different meaning depending on the speaker; care deeply about something intangible; value playfulness as a form of art; know what you want but you take care when getting it; read; identify as a queer person of color or immigrant or special understanding unicorn; are 95% satisfied with your life and 5% looking to quicken your pulse.\n",
      "i'm confident, dedicated, kind, dorky, a good friend, level-headed, emotionally balanced and i look for qualities in others that i value and want to improve on in myself. honestly, i just want to have fun, explore more of this amazing city and get to know some great people while i'm at it. i recently got a new job running a little 4 bedroom inn and signed a lease on a beautiful new apartment with my two friends. traveling solo and going to grad school for higher education/student affairs are in my plans for the future, but right now i'm trying to do things that inspire me and learning about the world as i go along. singing and harmonizing keeping a clean plate - literally driving whistling hosting parties making dogs fall in love me i'm usually smiling. music: i love soundtracks - elizabethtown, avatar, high fidelity, once, sleepless in seattle, charlie's angels...as for artists - florence and the machine, janelle monae, metric, robyn, aqualung, k.d. lang, annie lennox, mumford & sons... tv: the office, parks & recreation, modern family, stargate atlantis, nikita, alias, parenthood, flashpoint, game of thrones, 30 rock, firefly, legend of the seeker...i'm a little nerdy when it comes to tv shows. movies: too many to name, but i'll list some of the kinds i'm into: i'm weirdly into war/fighting movies, i love engaging movies with real characters, (esp. women with actual character development), and a great soundtrack. i also love movies that make you want to go on a road trip or do something different (like the time i watched g.i. jane, did 300 sit-ups and proclaimed i was going to join the army) books: game of thrones, the informationist, girl with the dragon tattoo series, the man from beijing, the lost symbol, anything by paulo coelho ... food: avocados, freshly baked bread, brussel sprouts, sushi, beer & wine my voice music companionship hope the ocean time alone graduate school/gre/my career when i'm going to work out what i want from my next relationship how i want every dog i see 1. out with friends exploring new and old spots in the city 2. going for a run before making dinner at home 3. at home having some \"me\" time with netflix, christmas lights and my bear blanket i've recently realized i generally have a \"type\" when it comes to romantic interests: semi-androgynous, confident, and kind-hearted but not overly affectionate women :) you want to hang out casual style and see how things go...then go on a unique date\n",
      "hey hey.  i shall begin by saying that i live an active lifestyle, so i love to working out and jog. definetly a health concious person or \"health nut\" if you want to be mean.  i m also an avid fan of fine dining/cooking, so i m constantly looking for new places to dine at. from american food to zimbabwe cuisine, i will eat it all. my motto is: \"try it for the experience\"  when i have free time i ride my motorcycle. it feels great to have wind blowing in my face while taking the twisties in sausalito. on the weekends you can probably find me in downtown hopefully functioning normally :)  i'm known for being a \"jack-of-all-trades\" kind of person. people come to me for everything. also, i enjoy making people laugh. telling stories is an area of my expertise too. working on my dietitic degree as of now.  scheming to open up my own restaurant in the near future.  one of my life long dreams is to do a backpacking travelling tour of asia. making people laugh, listening, coming up with interesting ideas, having intelligent conversations, having unintelligent conversations, telling stories, cooking, tasting fine liquor and enjoying fine cuisines. sincere, funny, nice, thoughtful and handsome guy :) 1984, the prince, the colbert report, arrested development, italian food, pho, kpop, and classical piano. my parents water food sleep motivation humor what i need to do tommorrow reminiscing the past hanging out with some buddies, dining out, drinking at the lounge or going for a ride on my sportsbike i used to be really fat. you are a nice person.\n",
      "i'm awesome basically. i'm genetically superior, funny, intelligent, musical, am going to make more money than you... oh and i'm humble too.  i'm a huge tease, endlessly play games, am incredibly shallow and immature. if you are down for being spun around my little finger, hit me up! i would tell you, but i want you to like me for me. i'm not just a career you know. -balancing things on my hand. no i'm being serious, my record is like 30+ minutes for a balancing a pool stick.  -naming things (see later in profile). i need to figure out how to monetize this. million dollar smile. nuff' said.  the second thing is usually my pleasant fragrance.... it's a mix between fresh cookies and pine.  third would be my dance moves. nobody dances like me. nobody. you might be thinking right now \"psh, i can handle it.\" no, no you can't. you're wrong. i make no apologies about liking:  books - richard dawkins is my broseph  movies - a beautiful mind, anything with keanu reeves (is there anything he can't do?), beverly hills cop  shows - white collar, how i met your mother, entourage, nova, that one show about yo mama jokes with the dude from that 70's show  music - electronica, anything that's emo (i'm talking like fat britney spears emo), j-biebz for life  food - i love sushi, it's kind of a problem. that stuff is like crack for me. 1. sewing needle.. because i'm pretty dang ripped.  2. pinky ring.  3. moleskine. world's most useful invention. if you get anything out of reading this profile, it should be to go out and buy one of these badboys. mine is in \"hotrod red.\" this isn't a joke. i would never joke about moleskines.  4. musical instruments. i would go crazy without charlize the well tempered and agreeable piano and jebediah, the hard working but close minded guitar.  5. my free verizon phone. no wait actually, i hate that thing... but i'm too hipster to get an iphone yet. i refuse to join the sheeple.  6. my friends. i loves yooze guyz. terrible jokes. example: what did batman say to robin before getting into the batmobile? \"robin, get into the batmobile.\"... that one always gives me a titter. i'm definitely not indulging my rampant alcoholism..... i secretly wonder how long anatomy book artists spend deciding how big to make the guy's penis. you are attractive (as i mentioned, i'm extremely shallow) and are turned on by megalomaniacs who are great in bed.\n",
      "over the last few years i felt i have really come into my own in life and found what i finally wanted to do with myself and pursued it. i am an artist working on honing my voice and finding a way to get it incorporated into my everyday life. i consider myself friendly and pretty easygoing. though i may not be the person to always suggest new things to try i will often go along with them. being around the company of good folks is where i am most comfortable. i enjoy reading and writing and the processes involved in them.  i am positive, creative, and loyal i am currently working and getting back into the gym on a more consistent basis. i am trying to get a few things ironed out before i start grad school this fall at sfsu. i also manage to fit volunteer work into my schedule and i try hang out with my good friends whenever possible. i'm a writer and i fancy myself to write some pretty good and funny stuff. i'm also a pretty good listener and i like to be there for folks who are close to me. i can lighten up and not take myself too seriously which is becoming a lost art amongst people. i retain a lot of knowledge from the stuff i hear to the point where i am a wonderful repository of useless knowledge.(which is awesome for quizzes and boardgames.) i can also quote conan the barbarian better than anyone i know! appearance wise the first thing that folks notice is that i am pretty tall around 6 ft 4 inches. sometimes it takes me a little bit to open up to people, but i have a pretty good sense of humor. i read a good amount since i am an english major that being said i am not a book snob. i read both the more serious literature to expand my mind to fluffy science fiction as my brains comfort food.movie wise i think alot of my favorite films came from the 80's. the action movies in particular i enjoyed the unapologetically cartoony feel that the decade embraced. princess bride and labyrinth were also good ones and i think that up would have to my favorite pixar movie. i also have a weakness for terrible horrible campy movies i can't help but watch the train wreck. music i really started listening around the grunge era in the late 80's early 90's so that shaped a lot of the stuff i listen to even to this day. if i had to be pinned down to three favorite bands currently it would be lo-pro, karnivool and pearl jam. i do listen to a pretty wide variety stuff minus most country (johnny cash being an exception.) and rap/hip-hop (minus the stuff that cracks me up.) some of my favorite foods are japanese (regular stuff moreso than sushi), mexican (traditional not tex-mex) and probably puerto rican food. 1. the internet (don't know how i could live without it.) 2. the company of friends. 3. good conversation. 4. snuggling 5. beer (who knew i was missing out on so much for so long!) 6. the nfl i tend to be spacey from time to time but i am carrying a notepad around with me so the ideas that float around in my head don't disappear back into the ether. my thoughts since i got accepted into grad school have largely been focused on that and how much i have missed the academic aspects of my life. working the morning shifts that i have for a while sometimes too often i think of how much sleep i will get that night. sometimes i think of movie explosions like its one giant micheal bay film in my head. (without a plot stretched thin over too many characters!.) i try to head out a bit and be social on fridays whether it is hitting a bar that a friend dj's at or going out and gaming a bit. i am also content sometimes just staying at home and having a beer and watching a movie or two. i sometimes sleep with fan on because the white noise soothes me. you want to know more about me or if you just want to chat. or if you need to know what is best in life. ;)\n",

      "i'm a man in my 30s. i've initially signed up here on the good word of a friend, so right now i'm just dipping my toes into the pool. i'm a cubicle dweller during the week, with some volunteer work (hiv test counselor & phlebotomist).  right now i've also become obsessed with answering questions just to see what kind of person this site's little robot brain thinks i would be friends with. it's also nice to see i may have enemies out there who i haven't even met yet, thanks okcupid.  now with the locals feature i tend to people watch when bored. working, trying to either move upward at work, or possibly returning to school. trying to meet interesting people and do more with the friends i have. i'm also trying to flush out a halfway interesting profile. i'm watching my stalkers for the mild flattery that comes with random people checking me out, even if they are nowhere near a match for me. apparently being dependable for random friend things i have minimal interest in. this explains about every time i've been to a dance club, and helping people move. but if you return the favor by going to see some band or comic i like, i'll love you for it. i'm also good at semi-obscure pop culture references, including remembering a myriad of useless facts. the volunteer work has made me a better listener, but i sometimes get stuck in that mode. i'm also good at writing run on sentences if you haven't noticed. well from far away probably just my height (6') and outline. people probably also notice that i'm a fairly mellow, even-keeled kind of guy. i'm a bit quiet at first, but once i warm up to someone i'd like to think i'm an alright guy. books: slowly getting back into leisure reading after being ruined for it by school. i tend towards non-fiction stuff, often related to the volunteer work. i'm slowly working my way through \"stiff: the curious lives of human cadavers\". the last books i've read for courses that were enjoyable were \"and the band played on\", \"latino gay men and hiv: culture, sexuality, and risk behavior\" and \"hooked: five addicts challenge our misguided drug rehab system\".  movies: airplane!, annie hall, high fidelity, 24 hour party people, and (500) days of summer for starters off the top of my head.  music: again, i try to keep a diverse interest in things. if you must pigeonhole me, my top played songs include: the lovemakers, portishead, doug stanhope (great stand-up comic), tom waits. my favorite bands overall are probably the smiths/morrissey, radiohead, and the clash.  food: i live in the sf bay area, i have options, and intend to make use of them. 1) sugary, caffeinated beverages 2) bananas or apples 3) a decent music player (cd player/ipod/record player) and some good speakers/headphones. 4) self-efficacy 5) ? 6) ? generally all manner of ephemera, unfortunately nothing productive. when i am focused it's public health including interventions, behavior change.  i've noticed that okcupid seems to be splitting agnosticism vs atheism as religions. even though there is a significant difference, i'm just not sure how much it matters here. i'm more agnostic, but i'd be willing to convert for somebody who comes from a devout atheist family. seriously, has anyone ever converted to atheism or agnosticism for a spouse? leaving the gym at work, trying half-heartedly to pull something together with friends for the night, only to end up watching whatever i have from netflix. i'm mildly embarrassed by my non-witty name on here, i wasn't feeling creative when i first registed. you want to say hi, ask me a question, send me hatemail, suggest edits to my profile, either way i'll probably be flattered.\n",
      "i'm independent, driven, thoughtful, outgoing, positive, self-confident, mature, intelligent, friendly, and funny. i'm looking for a girl with all of those things, plus who laughs at my jokes and has a huge smile. i'm not the kind of guy that rushes into serious relationships quickly, but i'm also not scared of getting serious. going to business school at stanford for my mba  used to work at a venture capital fund where i invested in really cool startup companies in the tech space  enjoying the california weather!  i've just started to get really into biking i think i'm a really thoughtful listener and good conversationalist. i love hearing people's thoughts on the big and little things, and i love just learning about other people. i'm also pretty funny, at least i think so ;) probably my smile and my outgoing and positive personality love thai food but am very adventurous when it comes to food.  tv: modern family, parks and rec, californication, curb your enthusiasm, boardwalk empire  movies: good will hunting, thomas crown affair  music: weezy, yeezy, jeezy, hov, dave matthews, black keys, but i listen to a ton of stuff great friends and family cell phone mac + internet access fun, challenging career one day, my wife and children how to change the world how to advance my career how to have fun and build better relationships w. friends and family out to dinner then drinks with friends. usually someplace classy but casual i love to cuddle? if you just want to meet a cool person and hang out sometime  you're self-confident\n",

      "so many things so little time.... i'm a chem prof (phd.) who almost became a psychologist. my life ran in decades with 20-30 working on school... 30-40 playing electronic space music and making albums ... 40-50 doing video visuals for all night dance parites... and now for my next chapter?? i'm obviously a person who likes to think but i just as obviously like to \"art\"... i've studied science, electronic music, nutritional chemistry, photography, video editing, yoga, hypnosis, eastern philosophy and mediatation, taken my share of enthiogens to aid my vision... currently i work out a lot and want to do more yoga and pilates so i am in very good shape. i've camped and danced (literally) in magical outdoor locations all over ca.  i am energetic, kinetic, and enigmatic getting ready for summer when i will have no set schedule - part of the benefits of teaching at a college. i hope to fire up my synthesizers and play some electronic music, go to some of the musical/dance campouts of the sf underground, and begin taking a lot more pictures with my digital camera. until then i have to finish the next couple of weeks at school where my students will take their finals and i'll close down another year. acting as a catalyst for ideas and exploring new activities, thoughts and actions... i'm at my best when i can inspire others to explore possibilities. hummm - i should ask but i imagine it has to do with energy. sometimes i probably appear nervous and maybe in some frames of reference i am... i figure i don't look like i really am which is great because it allows me to surprise many people. so many and they change as i go... i have much more broad tastes than most people i know... i can hang out with a country boy mechanic and have things to share or i can hang with a scientist or musician or visual artist or people from other countries all equally as well.  i just converted most of my albums and cd's from the last 30 years into mp3's and i'm enjoying old electronic music right now: heldon and jarre from france, tangerine dreram,klaus schulze and kraftwerk from germany, vangelis from greece and far east family band from japan. favorite music: really spacey electonics or eurodance deva vocals or african or indian for various moods - least favorite really negative stuff from: hip hop, punk, heavy metal and goth particularly the \"put down\" vibe expressing rage... i prefer music to express hope rather than fear and loathing... oh and country i can hear for a time but cryin' in my beer is just not me....  movies i like for various reasons: hildalgo, interview with a vampire, the game, dhoom and dhoom 2, alejandro jodorowsky's the holy mountain, unfaithful, never been kissed, hearts in atlantis, silence of the lambs, rocky horror ps, baraka, under the tuscan sun, must love dogs, con air, hunt for red october, october sky, the sure thing, ben hur, solaris, top gun, officer and a gentleman, the rock, indiana jones and the last crusade, pulp fiction, phenomenon, lord of the rings, spiderman and wild at heart (love the theme song) not really into porno because it is so mindless but i love erotic- the idea is \"banging a slut\" is porno and a real turn off... making passion is a mental turn on like wild at heart, unfaithful, thomas crown affair or dracula....  i've not eaten birds or mammals for 30 years - but like seafood... with that out of the way... pick a country - any country and i pretty much enjoy their food. my spirit center point of consciousness that has recognised itself ever since i can remember, my health, a forest nearby, hot water - it's how i wake up and how i relax, skin to touch, and music to play and play with... how people grow up and become sophisticated in ways that make them really foolish so that things like peace, harmony and love become difficult when in fact any child knows they are simple facts of a life well lived. what i really want to do next. typically involved in whatever arrives... tonight i am going for a walk. i'm way more sexual than most people think but i approach it through my mind- it's a mental thing that expresses through deep touching. and on the mundane i've been enjoying workout with jackie my favorite lesbian trainer.... you think maybe you should for a reason that is beyond reason but still makes sense.\n",

(kudos if you know that reference.)  i will admit that i veer more towards the tattooed artist than the waitress / actress who doesn't own a book.  i like women who know what they want and aren't afraid to say it. (that's code for girls who won't make me choose what type of food we're eating and then pick at their food because they don't actually like thai food and of course i really should have known that. also...girls who talk flirty and dirty.)  short term dating: you like to laugh, you have a sexy voice, and you don't outweigh me. (no problem with proportionately curvy...i'm just saying. i'm 180 and 6'4\"... i don't want to go out with a woman who can crush me in a poorly planned maneuver.)  long term dating: if you're dead set on 2.05 children promptly (that's the current stat apparently), i am probably not your best bet.  i don't have anything in particular against the concept of a long term relationship with kids, dogs, and white picket fences. i have been in love more than once and more than one person has been in love with me. just haven't found myself mutually enamored yet. so my relationships have always been well under a year.  i believe cosmo will call that a red flag so beware!  drug use: i'm tolerant of casual drug use and have indulged myself. still, if your primary mission in life is to escape from it every weekend, we will probably not get along in the long term. by that i mean that if a personal problem makes you reach first for a bottle, a joint, or the tv remote then you need a better life.  i think nitrous is one of the dumbest drugs imaginable and would rather date someone who takes a spiritual interest in psychedelics than someone who might as well be huffing magic markers to get high.  regularly scheduled maintenance: lastly, if your beauty routine takes several hours to complete before going out for a bagel or you're not comfortable with your own appearance (read: ongoing surgical aspirations) the chances of us getting along are lessened over the long term.  don't read this last part to mean that i'm not an aesthetically motivated pig. i am a guy. you will inevitably catch me checking out the bartendress at some point. it's just that i prefer to date someone who looks good before they spend a few hours spackling over the crevices. also, and i know this will come as quite a shock, insecure women can be tedious.  in the short term of course, i am more than happy to play with your plastic boobies.\n",

      "i like to challenge myself in pretty much every area of life, i don't drink or do any drugs, and i'm always happy because i think being alive is amazing. i spend about half the year in my rv in san francisco and the other half traveling around the world with my friends. i make a living off the books i've written, but for the past year and a half or so i've been building up a startup, which takes up a bunch of my time.  generally i just do whatever i want to do, which tends to be productive and interesting stuff. my hobbies right now are teaching myself to play the violin, writing my first novel, memorizing decks of cards (long story), learning to fly planes, riding my motorcycle, and playing poker. writing, mostly because i've been doing it for so long. traveling finding adventure getting out of trouble feeding squirrels singing gangster rap karaoke blue eyes, probably. or the raw sexual energy bursting forth from my loins at all times. books: difficult conversations, sherlock holmes, fountainhead. i read a lot, so i think these change a lot.  movies: casino, ponyo on the cliff by the sea  shows: les miserables was probably my favorite. most of the cirque shows are pretty awesome, too.  music: jay-z, rick ross, frank sinatra, beethoven, mozart, johnny cash. not much else, to be honest.  food: gracias madre, burma superstar, chilango, millenium, good tea i guess my laptop because it's how i make a living, but if i didn't need it for that, i'd be pretty happy with nothing. different trips and adventures i could go on, interesting things to learn, how different people perceive the world, happy thoughts... these days i'm programming or writing. sometimes playing poker, often times hanging out with friends in some foreign place. i bought an orchid because it smelled nice. you're a happy person who has some sort of ambition... not necessarily to make a ton of money or whatever, but someone who doesn't just live life as part of the unthinking masses.\n",
      "feminine is the best way to describe me, from my mannerisms, to my curves, to my style of dress. i am more comfortable in skirts then jeans, but i do own a pair or two. i only wear sneakers when i exercise. my worst habit is my addiction to lipstick, but don't panic my lipstick is organic!  i am a positive, kind, social, compassionate woman and i am loving life. i am eclectic and that is reflected in how i think, who i am friends with, my spiritual beliefs and the music i listen to.  i believe that we are here to learn, to love and to laugh! life is a school for souls and we are all students.  i derive great joy from many things in my life. i like helping people become aware of developing eco-friendly practices. another thing that brings me joy is music. music sets my soul free. writing is something i discovered in the last few years and i am working on writing a book. i have many, many, deep, caring, friendships and i value spending time with my friends and family.  i am looking for a man who is healthy in body, mind and spirit. a gentleman ( a gentle man) who has the soul of an artist and the heart of a poet and the spirit of a sage. he needs to be loving life and not looking for happiness to happen once he meets a woman.  and, if i am really honest, i have to admit that how a man dresses can be a turn on or a turn off for me. i am not into crocs or birkenstocks, especially when worn with socks. i think i may have a shoe fetish, so a man wearing a nice pair of shoes catches my eye. well fitted jeans and shirts, really do it for me and a man in a nice suit oh baby! not a must but i am just saying i am enjoying each moment of my life and appreciating all i have. i give back when i can, which is my way of showing gratitude for all the blessings in my life. sounds sappy but it is true. helping others in any way i can teaching children with learning issues how to read making people laugh fixing yummy grey hound cocktails (some friends call me a mixologist) kissing thinking deeply hanging out at the beach for hours on end my hair, then my eyes, then my smile. my favorite places are: cole coffee, mua, lake chalet, gather, cafe van kleff, room 389 folly beach s. c., paris, bali, capitola, amaganzett, n.y. and of course oakland!  some favorite tv shows: californication, weeds, glee. awake, touch, eli stone  some favorite music: coldplay, david grey, the smiths, the california honey drops. gorillaz, black eyed peas, snow patrol, collective soul, death cab for cutie, michael franti , angus and julia stone... to name a few.  most recent reads: a pocket history of sex, the madonnas of echo park, the lotus eaters, love and other impossible pursuites, the language of flowers.  all time favorite books and authors: be here now ( my bible since i was 16), princess bride ( love the movie also). love in the time of cholera, all of paulo coelho's and jhumpa lahiri's books.  movies: all time favorites: donny darko, brother sun, sister moon, and king of hearts, children of men, broke back mountain. i love movies, there are too amny to list... of course i could do without these six things as i know things do not ultimately make you happy, but i will play along my friends and family warm summer days at the beach, with a warm ocean and waves you can body surf mindfulness (of myself, others and our beautiful planet) hummingbirds organic locally grown foods chocolate, no music, no chocolateno musici think i need both. lately been thinking about summertime and long hot days in the sun, reading and playing. ( of course i think about other things like the state of our planet and the struggles of others...) depending on the week i could be at a local happy hour in oakland or having dinner with friends. if it has been an exhausting week or if i have a really busy weekend planned then i am might be home relaxing and enjoying a netflix movie. i am not shy and i will tell you just about anything but only face to face! i saved you to my favorites list. if you are looking for a deep, meaningful, amazing drama free relationship.  .\n",

      "i love every second of my life. life has shown me so many aspects of existence and has made me sensitive enough to hear some of the messages carried by the dna of nature. i love laughing and going on adventures. spray painting, sneaking into hot-tubs, jumping on roofs, you name it girl! i love talking to the ocean. one time i had a conversation with a cellphone tower, and it enlightened me with a whole new different world prospective. i'm an experimental particle astrophysicist by degree and heart. worked at a particle accelerator, a gamma ray detector and a superconducting magnet r&d program. a few years ago i started a company building super-cool electronics. fun is growing very promisingly :) aaaaaaaaaaand...... i'm a freak when it comes to karaoke. i'm taking a big bite out of it and getting its juice all over my face building things going to goth shows and dancing my butt off. dressing up better than anybody else at the party i have no clue mcsweeney, anything feynman wrote, freakonomics, alice in quantumland, american psycho, history books, anything by lisa randall. the fall, braveheart, the dark knight, alfred hitchcock, a night at the roxbury, action/psychological thrillers, the quantum activist, cosmos. the coachwhips, vnv nation, cyndi lauper, the christal method, michael jackson, and many many more... dancing, traveling, extreme storms, being passionate, working hard on new projects and dancing i think a lot about how matter comes to life. alternative forms of life. new inventions (sounds redundant). new songs and beats. where i want to travel, what events i want to go to and with whom. it's pretty random. i might be partying like an animal at a warehouse show, or at my office getting some work done, or running a couple of miles or cooking... or something else i was into metal and had an indy metal label about 8 years ago. even worst than that.... there was a small glitch in my life of about six months when i would wear baggy pants half way down my ass..... and i have a picture to prove it :) you are rad and want to make a new friend. or, want to kick it in the hot tub while smoking hookah and drinking honey wine. or, you are looking for a cool dance party to go to\n",
      "i'm terribly shy, and am prone to turning bright red and speechless around men i secretly harbor crushes on. however, i'm a cheeky, clever conversationalist once i've regained faculty of speech.  i keep fit with ballet classes, rock climbing, and forcing myself to run---oh, how it hurts!! i keep mentally stimulated with building things, working with my hands (i like refinishing antique/vintage furniture, and slowly working on my tiny sailboat), reading my way through the ever-growing pile of books beside my bed, and engaging with my small circle of friends who are smarter than i could ever hope to be. my work in music orchestration is tremendously challenging, engaging, and sooo satisfying once i've sorted out my usual obsessive approach to a project....my mates are mostly outside of my field, and i prefer it that way. there can be only one egomaniac musician type to a group. that way there are enough to go around.  i'm english (charmingly so, i've heard) and have been in the us long enough to have relaxed decorum...it took a bit of work, though...i'm still not comfortable with high-fiving. i'll acknowledge accomplishments when due, surely, but never will i initiate a high-five!! !  edit: i'm from london. don't confuse me with the beans and toast eating, bed wetting sort found in the northern parts. how vague! i'm making time for the people and things that are important to me, but take care not to adhere to a repetitious cycle in every day life...though taking care of, and entertaining, my dog has been a pretty regular constant for some time now. such a hard life, that one.. .  my life doesn't often revolve around music, but when it does, it's not necessarily a bad thing. i'm terrible at filling out things like this--i'm not sure how i come off with mere samplings of my lifestyle and personality, but...i sketch often (see: roostercarp above), play around with stringed instruments, and have gone through more than a few travel journals. (i fill them up, i get around....i'd like to make time to get around more often!) ruining it for everyone else since 1985. probably my freckles... authors are easiest:edward gorey, jean paul sartre, jonathon kellermen, janet evanovich,,haruki murakami, j.m. synge, j.r.r. tolkien, t.s. eliot, oscar wilde, william shakespeare, tom robbins, penelope lively, margaret irwin, mark twain, henry wadsworth longfellow, lord byron, edgar allan poe....has my literary smugness shown through yet? no? ...lucy maud montgomery, lewis caroll, charles dickens, stuart woods, kurt vonnegut, roald dahl, aldous huxley, howard zinn, margaret atwood, ray bradbury, anthony burgess, tracy chevalier, rebecca godfrey, phoebe gloeckner, shel silverstein w.h. auden, rudyard kipling, algernon charles swinburne, william faulkner, evelyn waugh, philip roth  music: spice girls steven honigberg leonard rose dimitry markevitch claus adam natalie clein raphael wallfisch yo-yo ma friedrich grtzmacher hugo becker elgar, haydn, holst, shostakovich, sibelius ....iron maiden.  movies: i only watch foreign film, and independent pornography.  food: i wish i had the metabolism to eat roasted bone marrow on little bits of baguette all day. swiss army knife, 5-inch heels, my cello, jammie dodgers, little blue plastic baggies (curb your pets!). i go around in circles about women, men, politics, gender identity, sexuality...and what i'd fancy for a bite to eat.  i spend most of the day inside my head listening to, critiquing, writing, and generally just fussing about music line by line.. . my field isn't an extroverted one, and i'm alright with that.  filling out exactly what i spend my time pondering would require more of a commitment than i'm ready to make right now. wandering through whole foods/bi-rite/rainbow for key ingredients to base my sunday dinner menu around. dinner parties are more entertaining than watching people jockey for attention at bars and clubs any day.  friday is practically a holiday for those unfortunate enough to be 9-5'ers. these days it's impolite to segregate the haves and have nots, the fortunate from the pitiable, but making my own hours and working at more or less my own pace means that friday could unfold very much like wednesday or tuesday, or... you should and should not be jealous. butch women and masculine, well mannered men make me weak. i'm looking for the good stuff! be clever and kind, accountable and honest. i'm easily irritated when i feel like someone's holding back in a way that hinders my understanding---if you didn't already know, it's unwise to vex an english lady.  ... would also enjoy it if you were a bit of a pervert. not in much of sordid or taboo way (squirrel suits, and gas masks aren't necessarily for me..), but vanilla is for the uninspired.\n",
      "i think i'm fun. people often find me funny. i try to be nice.  i am a middle school science teacher and that is a big part of my personality (i.e. i really like people and i am a bit nerdy as well). (at first i wrote that i was dorky but i took a test to see if i was a dork, nerd, or geek and it said i was a nerd.) i am a fun nerd.  i'm pretty motivated for fun and adventure while trying to act like a grown up at work.  i like exciting things and quiet days around the house.  i highly value honesty. i thought everyone did but i guess not, my friend said i should put that on here.  i very much like kitchen and living room dance parties - alone or with friends.  i have recently been pretty into zombies (in terms of books and movies, not my dating life). i teach full time in antioch and i really like my job but it is a big part of my life and it is exhausting. i have found something that lets me talk about science all day and that lets me work with young people. i can't necessarily imagine doing this for the next 30 years but i like it now and i will probably always be doing something like this.  i really like my kids a lot but getting them in trouble when they are punk ass little shits can actually be really fun. *evil laugh*  i try to squeeze as much fun as possible into the weekends while still getting my laundry done and coming up with lesson plans for monday. i am very considerate. i am good at making people feel comfortable. i ask a lot of questions. i know a lot about the ocean. i can make my friends laugh. i like to clean and organize things. i am really good at puzzles. i have had some pretty great halloween costumes. i am good at arts and crafts.  bad at: lying being mean that i am a little loud. i am pretty easy to get along with. i ask a lot of questions but that is because i am genuinely interested in the answer. i like mystery books and honestly, i don't usually read them, i listen to them on my 30 min drive to and from work. i also read middle school books.  favorite movies i can think of right now: super troopers, the usual suspects, ferris bueller's day off, blue planet/planet earth, shaun of the dead.  i like funny tv. the office, 30 rock, true blood, dexter, weeds, wheel of fortune, how i met your mother, colbert report, flight of the conchords (but i think they are probably better live), uhhhhhh, other stuff too.  music - good shit! i like all genres so my taste is a bit eclectic. if i am paying money for a concert it is probably hip-hop or classic rock.  i like food. i am trying to eat pretty healthy right now and i go to the the farmer's market every weekend. family friends being outside jokes! science umm, how many is that? toilet paper. i have gotten pretty accustomed to using it over the last 30 years. transitioning to using something else sounds trying and making my own would be tedious. i am very curious, i spend a lot of time thinking about everything.  mostly i think about how i can get everything in my life done, but really i am tired and just want to lay on the couch.  sex - everyone does right? especially while i am sitting in traffic.  i feel like i have to think alot during the day (my brain actually physically shuts down from 2:30p-3:45p) so when i get home i also really enjoy not thinking about anything. this is a bit embarrassing to admit but i am usually so tired on fridays that i pass out really early after a little tv. however, if friends invite me to something fridays i will get some caffeine and i am in! shhhh, i watch reality television. only the good stuff. nothing about bachelors or with the word \"wives\" in the title. mostly competitions where they make stuff or race around the world. you are fun and funny, nice and exciting, and if you know how to have an adventure but you also know how to handle your life.\n",

      "hello. i'm easy going, \"young at heart\", with my own photography business in san francisco. i am single, but find my greatest joys in the relationships i have with my friends, as well as the satisfaction i find in my work as a photographer. however, i feel a need for closer relationships at this stage in life. i'm less introverted these days than i used to be but still am most at ease in a one-on-one situation or with just a few friends. i warm up real quickly, however, when i get to know and trust someone. i am semi-retired but continuing with my commercial photography business out of love for the craft as well as a desire to supplement my income in these crazy times! i love activities with my friends and try to balance those with my continued involvement with photography. i live in a duplex house that i bought together with my best friend and his husband. (no, nothing like that; we have separate units!) it's like a little commune with a lot of boundaries and private space. we take care of the house together and occasionally take trips together. it's a wonderful relationship but lacking in the intimacy of my own partner that i still desire. i am most often in sf but occasionally take somewhat extended \"photo safaris\" (1 or 2 weeks) to further my interest in landscape photography. i volunteer with the sf aids foundation for the aids life cycle and other events and belong to local professional photographer associations. empathy, caring and tenacity (i really stick to projects until they're finished); listening; my craft of photography; making bad jokes; not being too serious; being too serious; home remodeling, diy; controlling my temper (too good at that); going to the gym regularly; working (playing!) with photoshop; my height and blue eyes! \"swimming pool library\", \"the line of beauty\", \"john adams\", \"the help\"; \"babel\", \"crash\", \"manon of the spring\", \"jean de florette\", \"the pacific\"; \"breaking bad\", \"weeds\", \"nurse jackie\", \"glee\", \"the good wife\", \"modern family\"; early, renaissance & baroque music and world music; thai, greek, french, mexican, california fusion food. friends, creative pursuits, friends, dining out, diy projects, kdfc (did i mention friends?) planning a nice photo, what i will do with my friends, liberal politics, psychological development, diy home projects, computer photo training, cutting my impact on the environment. having dinner and/or movie with friends or working on some photos or watching a netflix or itunes movie at home during dinner. i would sometimes rather be working on a cool photo project than snuggling with a bf. (sometimes!) ;o) you want to chat and get to know each other better.\n",
      "wow. a summary of my whole self. yikes.  i'll give you the brief version.  i grew up in a small new england town, desperate to find myself in a big, exciting city. i made a bunch of little movies with friends ranging from ridiculous to pretty decent. i went to film school in boston (plus a stretch in la), graduated, and kept on keeping on with writing and doing shorts and video projects. i produced & shot a feature film that premiered at a film festival in ma. then things went stale for a while (job market for creative types is not so great over in boston). i found the opportunity last year to haul ass across the country (again) and hit up the west coast. i'd never been to sf before but so far i love it. it's alive with culture and opportunity. plus, lots of great places to drink coffee in the morning and absorb alcohol at night.  i work from home mostly, so i'd like an excuse to get out of the house and experience some more of the city. maybe you can help me out. i really enjoy filmmaking and writing, and want to find paid work in that field. so i write stuff while ignoring the fact that i should probably live in la. i'm currently i'm making a living as a copywriter. but i still want to make the best movie ever made. and by the way, i'm working on it. pointing out plot holes, mending cowboy boots, coming in fourth at bar trivia (i will keep trying, forever) you'd be better off asking them, i don't notice myself all that often. unless i'm particularly snazzy. i absolutely love 30 rock, arrested development, seinfeld, mad men and breaking bad. classic favorites inlcude quantum leap and macgyver.  movies? give me three hours and i can make you a list! here's a taste: back to the future, mr. smith goes to washington, cool hand luke, sin city, batman begins, the apartment (see: username), sunset blvd, no country for old men (anything coen bros, actually), rushmore, true romance, the searchers, unforgiven, many many more...  as for music i'm a big classic rock and indie rock fan. recently i've been listening to a lot of springsteen (because he's so awesome). also enjoy arcade fire, dr. dog, van halen, and plenty others. 1. my computer 2. clint eastwood 3. money (sorry, it's true) 4. romance/adventure/something to look forward to. 5. friends and family 6. music/movies/great art how awesome bruce springsteen is. also, my future. writing, watching a movie, going to a movie, hanging out with friends in the house or at a bar. i'm not as motivated as i want to be. i've never had a one night stand. i love to travel and always want to, but have never been out of the country (lack of money and/or inability to budget are to blame). i can (and sometimes do) spend a great deal of time petting a cat. you're cool, like movies, have something awesome to do but nobody to do it with (like a movie, maybe), or want to get caught up on mad men.\n",
      "i am an avid cloud-watcher. i grew up in colorado and lemme tell you, the clouds there are awesome, skyscrapers in the air, cotton monsters! nature is my church, and that's why i recently moved to sf-- to be close to nature and groove on culture. yes!  i love to dance. there's nothing better than sweating my ass off on the dance floor. i love hip hop and 80's music and i used to go out salsa dancing once a week in chicago-- looking for a new partner.  to me, life is about the deeper undercurrent, the energy, the magic of the universe. if this weirds you out, then we are probably not gonna make a connection. i find the unknown elements of life far more interesting than what western science thinks it has figured out. singing, playing music, helping to create a better school climate at a crazy elementary school.  i currently sing in a doo-wop/soul band, but i've also headed up an all-girl punk band, a new wave/hard rock band, and a few down-tempo projects.  i actually moved to sf to study sound, voice, and music healing at ciis-- so now i teach wholistic voice lessons. i'm into alternative healing methods and have studied nutrition, energy healing, etc. i always joke that i'm ethnically new age, since i grew up in boulder co. all that stuff is no big deal to me, and has also shaped the way i view the world.  i'm into putting down roots right now, and exploring the bay area and ca in general. i lived in nyc for seven years, chicago for three... whew! ready to be here for a while. being open-minded and open-hearted. going on adventures--i'm usually up for just about anything, and i'd rather be out and about than sitting on my couch watching tv. my eyes. my curves. my enthusiasm. books: liking patti smith's \"just kids\" alot right now... reminds me of being a 20-yr-old skrappy artist rocker in nyc myself.  movies: if you quote it's a wonderful life at me, you'll have me. i know, it's cheesy, but i am in love with jimmy stewart.  music: antony and the johnsons, lila downs, julieta venegas, amy winehouse, prince, buena vista social club, buika, robyn.  food: my general go-to is brown rice and veggies when i cook. going out i love thai, chinese, hamburgers! i tried burmese for the first time in sf and am officially obsessed! i grew up super poor, so i never put much importance on \"things\", but if you're talking \"never do without\"... i sure couldn't be without:  sunlight- when the sun is out, the day cannot be bad. music- listening, making connection action! let's move it! laughter snuggling ('nuff said) how to consistently be honest and present with the people in my life. well, friday night i am usually busted from the work week and watching a movie or chilling at home. but, saturday!- i love to go out and engage with the world-- bloody mary's, concerts, dancing, whatever's new and interesting. i'm a funny balance of extroverted and introverted. i love to be out there connecting with people and the world...but i'm also secretly kinda shy. i need people to draw me out, ask questions, take their time with me.  also- to me, sex is a spiritual experience (and fun!)-- i have studied tantric healing and am interested in learning more about tantra with a partner. if you feel inspired to... if you're curious... if you have a fun okc date idea! i am sick of awkward coffee or drinks dates...\n",
      "i just biked across japan. like bicycle. i initially created an account on here years ago, and only remembered about it when trying to make a profile that i could turn into a fake account and make my friend who uses okcupid meet up somewhere, and then stand her up. she's in a wheelchair now, so i guess i won't be doing that. i lost my glasses in osaka, and i squint a lot now. i know its bad for my eyes, but i can't afford to get new glasses until my insurance kicks in. i pretty much have a deep contempt for a lot of things, but i try to keep a joke in mind until i get talking to someone, then its negativity time. the best time. i work, and hang out with my dog. sometimes i cook every night, sometime i drink every night, and sometimes i like to ride my bike. guilt trips. i don't really know, to be honest. i don't read, watch, listen, or enjoy anything.  http://www.last.fm/user/kittycrossbones a bicycle, my dog. i bet i could do without alot of stuff. i would pink on it. i don't think. i just spit words out, its fucking awesome. feeding my dog before anything else i can squeeze in before work on saturday. hah, you don't want to read it. words words words.\n",

      "in 2010, i decided that it would be a good idea to travel for several months by train through china, korea, russia, the baltic states and poland. it turned out to be an excellent idea!  in 2011, i started work on rehabilitating a run-down ranch in sonoma county (with some wine grapes). so far so good - it's a lot of fun!  really would like to make time for someone in my life - in nature or in the city - preferably both! personally: travelling when i have the chance. one major objective is to find a place where i could actually live with ease after the usa.  otherwise: various projects...figuring them out and getting them done. remembering places and navigating around. seeing the beauty in things. don't like chit chat too much and have little patience...unless i know you...then i hold you to an even higher standard :) a few books i've enjoyed: boomsday, captain blood , the stranger, lolita, white noise, old man and the sea, smoke bellew, eiger dreams, sherlock holmes, the ascent of rum doodle, the master and margarita, moby dick, big score...on my shelf is speak memory, heart of a dog, unbearable lightness of being, and money of the mind by james grant...  b: porco rosso, howl's moving castle / laputa, buena vista social club, some like it hot, the adventures of baron munchausen, mystery men, fight club, seven beauties, f. destin de amelie poulain, castle of cagliostro, kill bill, sky captain, bourne identity, match point, lord of the rings, iron giant, thank you for smoking, hannibal, matrix i, night watch, lost highway, blue velvet, casablanca, third man.  c: bbc's top gear  d:diverse, across all genres there are a few good songs, liking ragtime and jazz recently.  e: japanese, german, hamburger+steak, russian cabbage soup at max's, satsuma oranges, muscat grapes, gokuri squeeze drink, vitamin water 'rescue' the internet (it's love/hate) being outside being inside quiet time family fruit tarts \"i have often noticed that we are inclined to endow our friends with the stability of type that literary characters acquire in the reader's mind. no matter how many times we reopen \"king lear,\" never shall we find the good king banging his tankard in high revelry, all woes forgotten, at a jolly reunion with all three daughters and their lapdogs. never will emma rally, revived by the sympathetic salts in flaubert's father's timely tear. whatever evolution this or that popular character has gone through between the book covers, his fate is fixed in our minds, and, similarly, we expect our friends to follow this or that logical and conventional pattern we have fixed for them. thus x will never compose the immortal music that would clash with the second-rate symphonies he has accustomed us to. y will never commit murder. under no circumstances can z ever betray us. we have it all arranged in our minds, and the less often we see a particular person the more satisfying it is to check how obediently he conforms to our notion of him every time we hear of him. any deviation in the fates we have ordained would strike us as not only anomalous but unethical. we would prefer not to have known at all our neighbor, the retired hot-dog stand operator, if it turns out he has just produced the greatest book of poetry his age has seen.\" vladimir nabokov same thing i do every night...making new plans i own peacocks and want more of them. you'd like to make the acquaintance of a quality individual for conversation. you've got an artistic sensibility and sensitivity. a taste for some adventures outdoors. kind, open and accommodating personality. sometimes we seek what we'd like to hone within ourselves ;)  you're someone who also has capacity for imagination, with some interesting or creative goals in life. someone who would like to live for a time outside the us.  you know a place around here like club med where everybody arrives a stranger, but shares food and drink and mixes at round tables while practicing their language skills.  someone who is ready.\n",
      "i enjoy doing dishes because i think it's therapeutic in some sick way. i love to see what people have in their bathrooms for reading material because i feel, however misguided, that this says a lot about a person. color coordinated dishes and furniture scare the crap out of me, i love board games, tetris and am still playing civ 3 since civ 4 totally screwed me over. i never hold grudges believe it or not. my idea of a crazy night out is a walk, some food, a movie and the occasional excursion to a goth club where i get corseted up and twirl around in dry ice to dead can dance. i have a phobia against mayonnaise, and i read somewhere that someones nightmare date was when someone said that and the person ran away screaming because they thought they were insane, so i guess i better throw that out there so no one wastes their time :) to be totally honest, i'm not a big \"dater\", so if you're looking for someone to get to know and open to how that will turn out, i would love to hear from you since i'm looking for a fried foremost and then see what happens. again, at the risk of sounding like a wacko, i think it's good to say that off the bat so you can ..\"next!\" me right away if that doesn't sound like an option.  i am loyal, trusting, and hedonistic trying to find happiness it little things like a random e mail from a long lost friend, getting a decent grade on the first college text i've taken in 15 years or finding a dollar on the street. i work as a manager in a hotel downtown and i feel very lucky because i love what i do, where i do it and who i do it for which seems a little rare when i've done informal polls amoung friends. other than that i just go with whatever comes up., i ride the busses and trains around the city for the hell of it, and i used to love to cook, so i'm trying to get back into that. remembering song lyrics,taking staples out of things with my fingernails, finding creative ways to revamp frozen food using the least number of dishes possible, remembering birthdays because i think they're a big deal while avoiding all other established holidays because i hate feeling obligated to be cheerful and bake things just on one random day. i can blow way too much money at a frightening pace on itunes at 2 in the morning and often feel a sense of buyers remorse the next day (for example: did i really need the 16 minute version of \"no parking on the dance floor? does this really enrich me as a person?), i'm a master at banal small talk and dealing with all sorts of people because of my job and also fairly proficient at spending time making my own fun in my free time because i deal with people so much when i'm working that i value my quiet time. in a strange turn of events i've found that lately i can find the bright side to even the suckiest of conditions and always think \"there has to be a pony in here somewhere..\", i can name all 50 states alphabetically in under a minute too. that my eyes close when i smile and i've very animated. i either scare the hell out of small children or they think i'm some kind of cartoon character.  she is full if life and her smile lights up a room. she is loyal and caring and generous. she always knows the right thing to say, even if it hurts, it's sound advice. oh dear.. that's a lot to cram into one section. i just sold all my cd's a few weeks ago and gone totally digital and the hipper than god buyer nodded at me in appreciation and said \"you're an ecclectic beast, mel\" which i took as a great compliment so it's safe to say i listen to a lot of random crap, but my biggest play counts tend to be classic rock like cream, downtempo stuff like massive attack, lamb and portishead, a new appreciation for 90's bands like sublime and green day which leads me to believe that music has to age to really become important to me. food wise i can be a bit of a whimp having being raised on mac and cheese, but being in sf for 15 years has helped me branch out to thai, eheopian, mexican and tapas. books.. oh dear, authors include jonathan carroll, f scott fitzgerald, chuck klosterman, harlan ellison, james ellroy, edith wharton, neal stephenson, daniel boorstin, barbara tuchman, noam chomskey, henry miller and many more i can't dredge up this early. in movies i lean toward old film noir, anything that has even the remotest chance of scaring the shit out of me, speghetti westerns, sci fi and guilty pleasure girly chicks like steel magnolias and terms of enderment. pictures of my dog that just passed, my grass, my laptop, the painting my just deceased stepfather made of his house and a lifetime supply of tums. we live in a world of instant gratification, voyeristic and impersonal with all these electronic comminication options. i've never joined a site like this before, but another thing i spend a fair amount of time thinking about making a concious effort to step out of my comfort zone and give it a whirl. hopefully not working! my eyes cross when i lie and i sometimes use a \"work emergency\" to get out of something i don't want to do and people always believe me because i work in a hotel and it's open all the time, so anything could happen and has. dead people, fires, fires set by people who died.. you get the idea... you're looking to make new friends. i might not float your boat on paper, but i can be a sparkling conversationalist and i am an extremely prolific e mail and chat buddy who will spend hours listening to your problems and triumphs and never get bored.\n",
      "for me every moment is an adventure. it's all good, made more so when we're fortunate enough to share it with someone, where we give and receive genuinely, gracefully, finding joy in each other's joy... i am a fun, smart, creative, curious, loving, aware, interesting, very fit and youthful, attractive, accomplished, artistic, fine cook, poetic, sensitive and sensual, articulate man with 63 years of wisdom, and a lust for life who would enjoy meeting a vibrant woman interested in a new friend for an enduring adventure.  these words don't really describe us. it's better to meet naturally, smile, say a few words that lead to a genuine desire to speak and listen and crave for more... oh the temptations!  find me and we'll share, perhaps deeply. enjoying the adventure. what i am doing is not as important as the passion and joy that i do it with. i am grateful to be alive, healthy, and to have the attributes to indulge in so many things with an open mind, heart, body and spirit. many things. i've mastered some things in sport, art, cooking, business, empathy and human nature, mostly in unrelated paths where it required decades to reach a pinnacle. that learning now guides me in everything i do. i've discovered that i have a joy for life, a gentle nature with an edge, open, embracing what's in front of me, the people around me, and not being afraid. love at first sight... lol. i don't know. really, my perception of what people first notice has to be some degrees removed from reality. that's too much self absorption. i like to think that the last impression is more important, which hopefully is, i'd like to share more with him. ... we should all have the pleasure and luxury to fantasize... and not be swayed from living out our dreams. too much to list. anything that taps the depth of the senses, emotions, mind, and passions. you know, every day living with an edge. generally i like exquisite food that i/we can make or eat out. same with books, music, entertainment, simple or complex, but always leaning for delicious. breathtaking. willing to risk a flop. silly and fun is good too, but i strive for being wowed, and give back in kind. six things are not enough. i'll take it all. i'll be generous and give most of it away. the things i can't carry i'll leave for others to take. if we didn't have air, food, shelter we'd be dead. so that leaves the things within us that we all have if we're willing to be vulnerable (for me, i'm reaching for total emotional, physical, and spiritual vulnerability) ... love, beauty, compassion, empathy, adventure, depth, creativity, gratitude, contemplation. i had to break the six rule. 8 is a better number anyway - reflecting infinity. ... care to join me for the ride? too many things to mention here. i think deeply about a lot of things. it's all good. the one question that is not likely to be answered in human life time is \"why?\" ... i get closer but the answer is not reachable. i try not to think that far ahead. i am happy to be enjoying the moment... and when friday evening comes i will enjoy that time too. but if you have thoughts about friday or other days, i could be enticed to reflection and commitment. find me and i'll confess. if i'm willing to broadcast it then it's not worthy of being private. just for the hell of it. life is a joy and you'd like to share. you like engaging in deep thought and discourse. you want to fall madly and passionately in love. if you like adventure.\n",

      "none of this is accurate anymore. and i don't really care.  why is this my job? you figure it out. i do what i can with what i've got, which is considerably more than most. i hate the fact that money fuels this world and that so many things enjoyable are reliant on it. i'm very salt-of-the-earth and enjoy working for my means but i'm more interested in exploring the possibility of new kinds of fun i can have sans monetary expulsion. i'm really good at whatever i set my mind to. i have yet to really find anything i'm bad at, per se... i'm really good at forgetting to look both ways before crossing the tasteless joke street. i'm really good at messing things up the harder i try not to; so why try? i'm really good at talking about myself in the third person, also. and pretending certain people just don't exist. i've been told i have a very expressive face. and can dress myself well. but beyond appearance, people have observed in me a very dry sense of humor and a sensitivity to nuances that can only be learned from having once been a counselor. then people think i'm a raging snob. but usually they like me again once they've come to terms with my minor flaws. i've also been caught glaring for no apparent reason other than my face seems to naturally set that way. there's really no rhyme or reason to my book shelf and goodwill has also helped enable that. i lean towards sci-fi because i feel like if i'm going to immerse myself in something, it should be fanciful and an escape. i get enough reality from reality. and sometimes i'll pick up diagnostic manuals because they're a hoot. with my movies, if you can walk away from it going, \"what... just happened?\" i probably enjoyed it immensely. and as far as my music trends have been lately... a stark contrast between my soft, understated folk artists and my norwegian black metal thunder gods. but working in a record store for 6 years gave me multi-genre appreciation and i know a little of the best of every scene. or am at least open to new ones. give me some space-rock or lyrically meaningful hip-hop and i'm still just as content. audio/visual stimulus, my bike, positive interaction, smiles, sushi, and coffee. six things is such an odd standardized number for this question to be set to... i wonder how much research went into settling on that number. or if there's some vaguely satanic reference in here i'd be the first to point out... i spend a lot of time thinking about thinking. i'm curious about the machinations of everything we are, were, and will be. i take everything i learn and apply it to that. understanding creates a stability in person and globally. there's something to be said for a life rooted in stability, even if the occasional wobble provides perspective. probably watching movies and/or cooking. i need to start getting more into my projects i keep starting and setting aside, though. sometimes i can be found biking aimlessly through the city as well.  /bad habits i can't sleep without a constant barrier of white noise. it's the only thing that blots out the surrounding world and deadens the constant drone of ongoing trains of thought in my overwrought little cranium. i'm just kidding; i have a really big cranium. something i said has made you really angry. i'm dying to hear your complaints about how i live my life and how you think i should change it to better suit your needs. nothing would brighten my day more.  also, it's probably a better idea to actually message me as opposed to iming me since it really only looks like i'm on here all the time and i receive messages almost instantly on my phone otherwise.  if you list catcher in the rye as one of your all time favorite books, move on. just... seriously.\n",

(i know, if i have to ask) what did i purchase to justify receiving a high quality, nicely bound, over-sized ugg catalog? so nice, that i'm finding it hard to convince myself to recycle it. why the dynamic pricing of the curegreatest hits on amazon fluctuates a few cents every day, and why it's been in my cart for so long, since i already have most the songs. shakin' what my momma gave me (not much) dancing like nobody's watching (until somebody is watching) living large (on a budget) making my mind up, which seat can i take?'

      "i like to find order in chaos, but then again, i love unordered chaos too. i'm a try-anything-once kind of girl. okay, *anything* might be an exaggeration, but i tend to be the curious type and my favorite way to learn about something is to experience it. for example, i worked as a private investigator once. it was shadier than i expected it to be.  i'm from the east coast and my energy can sometimes be a little intense for super chill californians... but then again, when i lived in nyc, my friends all told me i was really \"west coast,\" whatever that means. i really like defying easy explanations.  i do know how to start a sentence with a word other than \"i\" -- see the following sections, please. being a filmmaker and rock star. (my username refers to cutting video, not myself. and if i could change it, i would. but then i'd have to come up with something clever to change it to.)  cooking. knitting. watching movies. taking photographs. gardening.  exploring new corners of the city and surrounding areas, sometimes on bike. thinking up ideas for adventure outings. reconsidering the things i think i know. getting excited about the things i learn. forgetting important lessons i've learned in the past, which leaves plenty of opportunities for me to learn them again and again! d'oh!  i am also really good at making soup. is my smile. or at least that's the thing they'll admit to. secretly, i think they're looking at my boobs. books: lately, i'm attracted to books that i can read anywhere -- sitting in the park or a waiting room or on a bench in the middle of a crowded farmers' market. as a result i've been read a lot of literary nonfiction, some nick hornby, short stories of various sorts. i'd love some new recommendations! i love salman rushdie and vladimir nabokov. when i was younger, i read everything ray bradbury wrote. i finally just read jesus' son after loving the movie for many years, and it is totally worth the 3 hours of your life it will take to get through it.  movies: many many documentaries but so many other things too. ask me about it and i'll tell you the last five movies i loved.  here is a random sampling of my music collection: gillian welch, belle and sebastian, ben folds five and to a lesser degree, the more recent things he has done solo, ani difranco (yeah, i said it), erykah badu, the shins, kathleen edwards, elvis costello, feist. there are many many more.  food: kale. quinoa. eggplant. heirloom tomato sauce. butternut squash ravioli in sage butter. a good burger, these days mostly of the veggie variety.  i love canceled tv shows like the state, arrested development, freaks and geeks, six feet under, party down and pushing daisies as well as some that are still on the air, like community which is pretty much my favorite thing in the world right now. my home, my friends, sunshine, stimulating conversation, music, pineapple  i find this question to be annoying and ridiculous. :) cultural notions of self and community, the infinite choices we make in telling stories, and the nature and expression of passion. wow, that makes me sound like i take myself far too seriously.  let's try again: what i'm going to eat for lunch, whether caffeine is a good or bad idea on a particular day, whether my outfit makes me look like a homeless person or not, and how to stop procrastinating and actually get some work done.  that's more like it. scrambling to correct the fact that i forgot to make weekend plans in advance.  or, if i'm top of things: seeing live music, playing live music, having friends over for dinner, watching a movie. regular leisure things, with an emphasis on the music. the password to all my bank accounts is: *********. you're intrigued, attracted, or offended by anything about me.  or if you want to hear/play some music, go for a bike ride, play tennis, go to a movie.  right now, i'm interested in connecting emotionally, intellectually, and socially. don't get me wrong, i'm into physical connection too. but i'd rather have a first date that ends in a lasting friendship than one that ends in a one-night stand.\n",
      "i enjoy being active especially biking and skiing. i ride my bike almost every day and try to get to tahoe every weekend in the winter. what's relaxing to me is watching a good movie with good company. when i get to know someone i really open up and show my funny side. i like to joke around and be goofy when appropriate but i do know when it's time to be serious. my view about work is, work to live, don't live to work.  i downhill ski race in the us ski and snowboard association (us ski team)  i am very spontaneous, i rarely have plans more than 2 days out, in fact most of my plans are made the same day. so if you ask me what i'm doing next week, odds are i don't know yet, but rest assured it will be total unplanned awesomeness! if you have to schedule everything you do we probably won't work out.  i am a jack of all trades. i have had jobs in many different fields, currently i work in it.  i am funny, laid back, and active. working in it to pay the bills, skiing and biking to keep a happy balance. i joined the ussa (parent organization of the us ski team and us snowboard team) last season so i could start doing official races. i've been skiing for so long that it was time to add a new challenge to it. i'll have to start the list with working on computers since it's a daily thing for me and computer science was my major. next i'll go with bikes/biking. i really enjoy biking and working on my bikes. i have 3 bikes currently, a road bike that i bought for the frame, pulled all of the components off and replaced with my preferred gruppo (sram force), a mountain bike that i like to take on trails in the presidio and marin and a commuter bike for riding around the city. i am a \"handy man\" around the house, i have past experience in electrical, plumbing and basic carpentry. i'm good at working on my car, i change the oil, have replaced the brakes, replaced an axle and other repairs. i enjoy getting my hands dirty when working on projects (but i do clean them when i'm done). maybe my \"accent\" that i don't really have. i'm a sf native but i must have picked up a slight accent from my relatives or family friends because i've been asked if i'm from england, scotland, canada, minnesota, the \"mid west\" and even once, australia.  i've also been told i have nice eyes.  while i was shopping in truckee i was approached by an lady (don't worry, she was in her 60s) to compliment me on my skiing in a race earlier that day. i have no idea who she was but she knew my name my favorite books are biographies and historical novels especially when things are almost too strange to be real. my favorite movies are generally action and comedy, when both are combined it's a real winner. i am a fan of all kinds of music, i played the trumpet when i was younger and occasionally break it out to play a few songs. i like all kinds of foods, sushi, mexican, italian, vietnamese, and i love a good burger. bike, skis, humor, friends, family and having fun my mind wanders a lot, so i can't pick any one thing that i think about more than anything else. when i'm in a meeting i'm usually thinking about anything but what the meeting is about. people tend to think i'm very patient, i think my mind is just full of random thoughts that i lose track of time. going out to dinner, watching a movie, meeting friends at a bar, driving up to tahoe, going to a friend's house to hang out i have been bitten by a penguin (their beaks are sharp!), had ferrets burrow in my sleeves, and \"wrestled\" a baby alligator.  i don't eat cake frosting. i would love to hear from you if you enjoy being active including but not limited to biking and skiing, but also like a relaxed evening. also if you are as sick of playing games as i am. i'm looking for a mature relationship, not high school style dating.\n",
      "i'm open to fun, friends, and dating. i could be described as well rounded, smart, easygoing, creative, inquisitive, passionate, affectionate, independent, with a good sense of humor. i am mostly in the mainstream, very liberal, but not too far left wing. i don't believe in stereotypes and thus don't live by them. nor cal born and bred but have been fortunate to travel all over the country. i'm interested in meeting guys about +/- 10 years of my age, mostly in their 20's and 30's. similar qualities and interests are a good thing. i graduated in 1999 with a bs in finance and have been working in sf since then in accounting. when i'm not at work, i love music, singing, dancing, hip hop dance class, working out, going to the movies or watching them at home, theater (broadway, musicals, comedy, drama), concerts (warfield, fillmore, great american are some fave venues), trying new restaurants, travel, hiking, walking, politics (democrats make me hot), comedy shows (frank caliendo, craig ferguson, dana carvey were amazing), street fairs, people watching, meeting new people, hanging out with friends, and more. -listening to people and offering advice -playing devil's advocate -seeing things from different points of view -planning vacations and events -spelling/punctuation -spending and saving money -finding my way around new cities -remembering facts and figures -debating based on facts -kissing -cuddling my height or that i look to be in my early or mid 20's music: way too many bands/artists to list, but includes pop, rock, top 40, alternative, indie, emo, r&b, hip hop, dance, country, classic rock, 80's, almost all genres except for extremes such as hardcore rap or heavy metal  movies: comedy, drama, independent, documentaries, over 400 movies are in my netflix queue  tv: (many guilty pleasures) american idol, glee, raising hope, wife swap, the middle, modern family, happy endings, cougar town, what would you do?, sex and the city, seinfeld, dancing with the stars, nightline, letterman, jimmy kimmel, ellen, true beauty, and of course all those 80's sitcoms that i grew with  food: i eat almost anything that isn't raw and love to try new restaurants since sf has about 3,000 restaurants. i've been to over 60 restaurants on the sf chronicle's top 100 restaurants list and almost all of the ones in sf on the chronicle bargain bites list.  cities: new york city, san francisco, portland, vancouver, honolulu, los angeles, boston, washington dc, toronto, seattle  travel: i've been to 49 us states (didn't make it north dakota because of all the flooding) and 4 canadian provinces. i usually take 4-5 weeklong trips a year (taking more than a week off at a time would not be pretty to come back to at work since i would have to do everything that i didn't do when i was gone). 1)friends/family/quality human interaction 2)good music 3)good food 4)good experiences/memories 5)curiousity about the world/life 6)travel to places new and old everything! no seriously, i like to think about what makes people tick, why they do/think/behave the way they do, the past, the present and the future, trying to learn from others and from my past mistakes, and about what makes the world go round (in a nutshell). (i'm not as serious as it may sound:) doing whatever happens to strike my fancy (see interests above) i have kept track of all 1800+ songs i have sung:) there's a physical attraction, we have any common interests, or we have a high % match.\n",
      "i know random, esoteric things. i can usually problem solve my way out of a tough situation (heaven help me the day i can't!) and i like surprising people.  i'm the person who will randomly spout chemistry equations at work, who gets references to recursive computer languages, but has a challenging time telling left from right.  i once made breakfast with only one (1) apple, string cheese, random nuts, and dried cranberries. that came from a food fantasy. i have them often.  i am bubbly, analytical, and thoughtful. i'm exploring new ways to connect with others and learning more about the things i don't know and the things i don't know i don't know. i'm trying to get more of the latter bucket into the former bucket.  what this looks like? during the week, i'm evangelizing technologies for paperless processes. i'm also working on several different projects on the west and east coasts. it also looks like reading about the latest technology and social media applications that come out and what's going on in that space. i travel quite a bit, so proximity to airports is very important to me.  i'm also observing people in real-life social spaces - on the bus, on city sidewalks - and sharing my observations. i'm really good at speed reading, asking questions, finding answers, and making lists. my smile - i get a lot of compliments on my smile which causes my smile to get bigger. prime example of a positive reinforcement of a positive behavior. my favorite books: bringing down the house, built to last, choice theory, liar's poker, running with the buffaloes, ender's game, middlesex, the art of war, the alchemist, fooled by randomness  my favorite movies: anything that makes me laugh, cry, or think  my favorite food: anything new or anything chocolate. i also really like vegetables. and meat. mobile broadband / iphone my computer my 3-1-1 bag major airport / public transit amazing shoes problem solving skills i like to think about my place in the world and the impact i have on others. i also like to think about how i spend my time and food.  concurrently, i'm also thinking about my next mileage run and when i'll hit the million-mile club. god knows where! it changes from week to week. i enjoy change... perhaps a bit too much! any of this resonates with you, you like answering questions and sharing what you know, and you can spell.\n",

      "bay area native, independent, political, animal lover (especially dogs), film lover.  i'm one of those people who could always (okay almost always) go to a movie. seeing films in theaters (especially old ones) is an irreplaceable experience.  i'm not fancy. i'd rather hang out in a dive bar or eat in an old diner than go wine tasting. i love old things -- old buildings, old clothes, antiques and memorabilia, etc. while i try not to consume or accumulate too much, i do like going to thrift shops, garage sales, and flea markets like the monthly one in alameda.  i'm a public radio addict -- fresh air, on the media, etc., the treatment (on film), bookworm, etc. i love to listen to college radio (kalx) and also kpfa. i've been winning tix left and right on kalx, as a matter of fact -- it's so easy.  i love to listen to people debate interesting topics, parse politics and new ideas, or talk at length about their art/modes of expression.  last fall i started an impromtu project/charity called first frost that involves collecting warm things for the homeless. i got a good response and friends and acquaintances got involved, took up collections at work and at holiday parties, etc. we got out the word at artmurmur, too -- i'm looking forward to making more progress when we start again this fall.  i couple summers ago i volunteered as a teacher at san quentin, which was a humbling and profound experience.  i've traveled throughout western europe, lived in spain and backpacked for several months throughout central america -- i would love to travel much more in the future -- in the us and abroad.  i lived in the southwest for two years and fell in love with the desert. i think western landscapes, such as utah, are so spectacular.  a bay area native, i lived in sf for nearly 10 years after college/europe and still in a way consider it home. but i live in oakland now and like it over here as well.  i'm a loyal friend who does better one-on-one or with a smaller group of people (slightly introverted but not terribly), but i can certainly enjoy parties and crowds. i enjoy observing people on the train and love to sneak peaks at what others are reading and listen to snippets of others' conversations (recently: \"no! i'm talking about the crockpot!\"), which is why i don't listen to my ipod on public transit. i often wish i took the bus more. call me a luddite, but it kind of depresses me how many people are desperately fixated on their little mini games and movies.  i'm not a big partier week after week. no longer. i abstain more often than not. drinking heavily is not interesting to me. been there done that, as they say.  as for why i'm on here: i'm looking ultimately for a lasting romantic partnership full of love and meaning. i like romance. i want it. i love flowers. that said, i'm independent, enjoy life as a single person, and i'm not interested in jumping into something unless it feels right. i'd also like to establish friendships through common interests, etc. and: power to the poly people but that's not what i'm looking for.  also, i am open to dating people who are divorced and/or have children, depending on the circumstances. i love children.  i am intuitive, questioning, and tenderhearted after several years in journalism i now work as a senior editor in book publishing. i'm also teaching at a community college. i have an mfa in creative writing (fiction) and enjoy writing short stories, reading, seeing bands and lots of films, taking afro brazilian dance, zumba, politics and activism, road trips, foreign travel, speaking spanish, etc. i stay busy with a writing group, doing dance, yoga and other exercise, and taking walks and hikes with my dog.  i also must eat gluten free and do some gluten free baking. if you are on the gf tip, give me a shout, please! we need to stick together. (okay, bad gf baking pun.) dissecting a film or book for an hour and then saying, what the ?*#! do i know anyway? avoiding the update of my personals ad. making gluten free muffins procrastination and then pulling off a tight deadline. talking to animals. making holiday cards out of old paper ephemera. not sure. i'm kinda short but people always think i'm tall. i'm a rocker at heart -- i listen to a mixture of garage/punk/indie. i love garage rock in the vein of the sonics and thee headcoats and also bands like the dirtbombs. of course garage can get old but when it's good it hits the spot.  i'm in love with the band delta spirit. i saw them play at a festival over july 4 weekend. i also saw he's my brother, she's my sister and they were great as well.  i also listen to things like brazilian carnaval drumming and old soul and hip hop. a compilation of soul from 1960s spanish harlem is a favorite as well as a disc of cheesy danceable 80s/90s hiphop from the favelas of brazil. i also just bought the cd of the long-lost band death, which is touted as a mix of proto punk/mc5/stooges/prog and psychedelic rock. just seven rockin songs -- it lives up to the hype. also listening to '60s era cumbia.  food -- i love mexican, thai, indian, and most other grub. the only trick now is i have to eat gluten free, so that narrows my culinary path a fair bit. i often think about taking a tour of taco trucks.  movies -- i'm really glad that a separation won best foreign film. it should have won for best screenplay! i thought the artist was sweet and well-done, but not dynamic, kind of one-note. i wasn't too excited about what i saw this year. i loved bridesmaids, actually, in spite of my efforts to be cynical about it. i loved tiny furniture, but that might have come out last year...  most recently, i saw the iranian film, a separation, and really admired it. it's tough to watch b/c of the subject matter (estranged family, class divisions, the struggle to take care of aging parent) but it resonated in so many ways by the end.  i love the 1964 japanese classic, woman in the dunes. what an amazing film. a movie that i've seen many times over the years is network. the paddy chayefsky screenplay is the best -- it's overwrought and hammy but for some reason it works. it's also very prescient. once years ago i rented a vhs tape of it that was busted but i could still listen to the audio and i still enjoyed it. other films i've seen multiple times include the big lebowski (i know i'm in big company there), caddyshack (sentimental favorite) and the woody allen film bananas.  tv -- i kinda have a girl crush on tina fey. i never paid attention to her until i started watching 30 rock. she's such a good writer.  books -- i just read a biography of the film critic pauline kael. going to start reading swamplandia by karen russell.  an all-time favorite book is a small collection of stories by dennis johnson called jesus' son. i seem to love narratives about underdogs and lovable losers.  i also read literary journals and mainstream pubs like the new yorker, the sun, harpers, the atlantic, etc. friends and family and animals and purpose -- although the last piece is evolving not sure of the rest what raccoons are up to. how i need to try harder to help other people. and stop beating up on myself. watching pbs on the geriatric tip. going to see a band or more likely a new film. watching a recent episode of 30 rock or the daily show. eating some cheap eats at a favorite place or a new haunt. drinking after work at the trappist. i'm creeped out by bands that have the word \"nickel\" in their name.  i was recently attacked by a dog which left a sizable scar on my face. hopefully it will fade. perhaps some will think it's sexy. :)  i don't watch much tv at all but i love dancing with the stars -- can't get enough. (okay now it's so you think you can dance) the spray tans, the smarmy host, the slutty costumes, the f-list \"stars.\" super cheezy goodness. on a serious note, it's cool to see the contestants work hard and improve week after week. dare i say it's inspiring.  p.s. sadly, i'm somewhat allergic to cats, as cute as they are. cat ownership/worship :) is not a dealbreaker, but it would be an issue to deal with. i'm open -- feel free to email me. just so long as you don't have the speed dating/online shopping mentality...  main thing: you are fine with being with someone who has a dog and who has a major dietary restriction (gluten free 24-7).  and please tell the truth about your age! i'm telling the truth and living with the consequences, which are much harsher for women, so i expect you to do the same.  you perhaps... like/love dogs and animals in general. are liberal and like to talk politics. care about social justice and try to do something about it. believe people can change. believe in forgiveness. like to travel and to dance. like to see live music in small(ish) venues love going out to movies. want a romantic partner to do creative projects with. are kind. like to write or take pictures or make films or make music.\n",

      "update: so i've been reading 'blink' by malcolm gladwell and apparently our conscious selves don't really know our true selves all that well. so below is my opinion but you'll have to get to know me better to discover the truth...  i'm very curious and like to learn something about everything or sometimes everything about something. challenges and adventure excite me. i've lived in 3 countries and 10 cities and currently in love with san francisco :). i am a wanderer...both physically and mentally. i have many funny (and crazy) stories to share! oh, and i wish that i was a rockstar...there is still a small possibility that might happen.  turn ons: intelligence, travel stories, culture appreciation, height, ambition, genuineness turn offs: self-absorbed people, anything kardashian, most celebrity lives, whiners working for a great company making cool stuff. at the same time wondering what the future holds for me and how i can get there getting to know people, giving advice, engaging in philosophical conversations... my smile and height. books: the sirens of titan, 1984 movies: gattaca, equilibrium, the dark knight, star wars, kill bill music: classic rock, british bands, anything with powerful guitar riffs, electronic or techno when i'm dancing... food: thai, indian, italian, mexican family + friends music my guitars iproducts good food passport who and what are worth spending your time on. where my next vacation will take me. should i go to grad school. at a friend's house or enjoying the city nightlife i love singing in the shower. you like to travel and want a travel buddy or just want to talk about the awesome places you've been to. you're smart and fun and want to explore the city with someone who'll make the experience even more exciting. you don't mind spending the afternoon in a museum and then hitting the dance floor at night! you speak french :)\n",
      "hi! let's see. i was born and raised in the midwest, in a large suburb outside a large city, so i'm pretty much all american, though i love the culture of my motherland and fatherland. a year ago, i quit my career and life to move out here and start a new life. since then, i've hang-glided, started muay-thai kickboxing, guitar lessons, and drawing with oil pastels. i am trying to live my life day by day, moment by moment. i went to law school and became an international human rights/domestic civil rights attorney, got involved in politics, making my way to washington d.c. it was there that my heart and soul were pushed to question my life. so, through synchronicity, i found myself telling my horrible boss i quit and signing up for phd program in san francisco. a year later, i know i made the right decision. i plan on lecturing, writing, and performing on cosmology and consciousness - brian swimme is my mentor. otherwise, it's all about fun and embracing the attitude i had as a child but lost along the way. empathizing; sports or anything technical with practice; even though i'm short i was a forward on my school basketball team; finding meaning in even bad movies; organizing things. i tend to be a leader, though i've stepped back in my leadership activities to focus on muay thai kickboxing, guitar/writing, and school.  laughing. i just want to laugh. my ninjalike abilities. i'm small, but so are diamonds and dynamite. favorite movies - shawshank redemption (hello, mother...), star wars, the matrix, pineapple express, office space. . . good sci-fi and good comedy. i also appreciate anything done well - so if you're into sports, i'd be down to watch as long as it's a good match up - i dig good plays, suspense, the clock running out etc. i also liked fast & the furious because it was done well.  fave shows - any good comedy (the office, how i met your mother etc). lost. i don't have tv anymore in an attempt to be more creatively expressive.  fave books - i read for school - brian swimme, thomas berry  fave music - don't laugh. i like pop. this has been excused by my friends and embraced by a few. i don't like all pop, but some. one republic. adele. counting crows. the fray. gaga. guilty pleasures, yay!  fave food - happy with anything; got a few idiosyncracies - i love bacon but do not eat ham or pork, huh. breakfast all day! why is that not universal? sandwiches! love sandwiches. i'm ok with any food - what gets me is the \"where are we going to eat\" conversation that can sometimes take tooooo long, so anything we can do to keep that one short, i'm all for! 1. my chai in the morning. the day does not start until. 2. pets. 3. comedy. 4. music. 5. family. includes friends. 6. going outside. how i spend a lot of time trying not to think.  i try to meditate daily so my mind stills itself and i think less but feel more and embody more.  the universe and our historical age and our generation's role in taking over leadership positions of the world's industries. philosophical ideas too, given my phd in philosophy, cosmology and consciousness. meeting up with a friend or two to plan an event or just to talk, eat, draw, write, or watch a movie.  i would like to go to more music or comedy shows. i love nothin more than being outside and listening to live music, while we lay out on a blanket. i have a great deal of faith and trust that the universe unfolds itself better in front of me by its own volition than when i try to push it down as i see fit. you feel so inclined. is there a tug?\n",

      "27 years summed into 27 words:  i grew up on the east coast, then came to california for graduate school, and stayed here as a software engineer. now i am enjoying life fully.  also, i just got back from norway, which was an amazing trip. almost nothing went as planned, and it just may be the best trip i've ever had. i'm including a link to my extremely long-winded travel blog, since it gets across my personality better than a short summary can.  http://craiginnorway.tumblr.com/page/3 i have a company that's launching a new product, which is taking up as much time as it sounds (ie. all of it), and i'm the lead engineer of it, so i spend a lot of time in front of a screen and keyboard.  otherwise, i'm hanging out with friends, rock climbing, and generally enjoying life. making people laugh. and science. i also choose to believe i'm fantastic at rock climbing.  i've also been told that i'm fantastic at karaoke. there's nothing like putting on a good show! things i have actually heard: my smile, my eyes, my beard. not necessarily in that order. books - house of leaves is brilliance beyond brilliance. if you haven't read it, you have done yourself an injustice. otherwise, let's see... his dark materials trilogy, anything by pratchett, american gods, and the comic bone  movies - scott pilgrim, kong pow, anything with jason statham  shows - south park, the daily show, colbert report, korra, avatar: the last airbender, wakfu. i'm hugely into cartoons and animation  music - poe is and always will be my favorite artist. otherwise i have an eclectic and (i'll admit it) awful taste in music. top bands i can think of off the top of my head: ludo, nine inch nails, evanescence, epica, cake, gorillaz, anamanaguchi, styx, barenaked ladies  food - pizza, sushi, or anything sweet. other people toaster strudels intelligent conversation music sunlight awesome trips how to live my life so it will make a great story. also my company. having a startup takes up a surprising amount of your time and energy. i'm bad at repetition i have an almost unhealthy obsession with how awesome ikea is, and i have a tendency to go there at least once a month. the programmer in me wants to just write, \"true;\" but that's way too geeky, so message me if you fall into either of the following categories:  1) you're awesome and just want to hang out (rock climbing, hiking, exploring the area, doing whatever) 2) you're awesome and looking for a long term relationship. i generally don't go for short-term flings.\n",
      "well i'm from new york originally but i'm the son of journalists so i've lived all over. i love canoeing, hiking, biking, kayaking, skiing and travelling in general whenever i can make time. i also enjoy video games, chillin on a couch and smokin weed so i'm a bit eccentric. we should just meet up and hash all this out. i'm self-employed working on a start-up i founded a few months ago to help people connect with their fellow voters and their representatives in government. i find my work very rewarding and satisfying but as a 20-year old entrepreneur it's hard to get out and meet people my age, especially when i'm simultaneously putting myself through cal. outside of my work i can still be a bit of a political junkie in conversation but i make sure to keep my work life and my personal life separated so i don't go mad. i certainly wouldn't describe myself as someone who defines themselves by their work. communicating and expressing myself. i love to debate, even though sometimes i do it just for the sake of doing it in which case i need to be politely told to stfu. if something is bothering me, you'll know it. luckily, i'm very easy going and it takes quite a bit to make me even moderately peeved about something.  trivial pursuit. seriously, watch out.  haikus: i could write thousands but that would be a bit creepy see what i did there?  i love languages and have been studying foreign tongues since i was a wee lad of 8 and i started learning spanish. i'm now fluent in both spanish and french and have been trying to teach myself arabic.  i am also an avid white water kayaker which i started doing when i was 13 and i've been addicted ever since (i'm from the east coast, more rivers than out here).  i've also been told i give great history and astronomy lectures. i'm seriously outgoing. i'm also seriously geeky. i love talking about politics, history, science and people very quickly pick up on the fact that i seem to have a limitless supply of what i call \"fun facts\".  the outgoingness (real word?) has its drawbacks though. i've been told i have no filter and just say whatever comes to mind so sometimes i'll sound smart but sometimes i sound like quite a simple soul. (for example today at work i dropped everything i was doing for fifteen minutes to think aloud why high-heels make more noise than sneakers when you walk) books: the phantom tollbooth (number one of all time), the great gatsby, lord of the flies, the curious incident of the dog in the night-time, the thief lord, the aeneid, the iliad, plato's republic, the prince (machiavelli), harry potter (gotta love em all)  movies: i tried and failed to come up with even a top 10. i love movies.  shows: 30 rock, amazing stories, arrested development, scrubs, cosmos with carl sagan, nova, south park, american dad, family guy, the office, house, law and order (all of them), gilmore girls (totally serious, i used to watch it with my lil sis and now i love it)  music: this one's tricky. i like certain artists in every genre. i love music in general. black star (mos def and talib kweli) is what got me into music in the first place though so they're my all-time favorite even if some of their songs are no longer on the top of my charts. in order of importance: 1. food 2. water 3. air 4. friends 5. the fifa world cup 6. entertainment (movies, music, tv) really silly what ifs. the future (not mine in particular just the future of earth). space. \"what am i forgetting to do right now\" is possibly my most frequent thought though. also tons of music is just constantly playing, it's great. watching some netflix or at a frat party. trying to get away from those though not my scene. sometimes i'll have shindigs at my house with a small group. art gallery hopping! i like you. you want to.  also, if you like outdoors stuff, gallery hopping, hip hop, jazz, watching shitty movies, playing video games, sitting around just talking\n",
      "one of my favorite things to do is to travel and visit different and new places. when i'm not busy planning a trip to go on, i enjoy spending time with my family and friends as well as getting the opportunity to meet new people. i work in the financial tech industry. being honest and planning trips! my smile? books: girl with the dragon tattoo, the hunger games trilogy, shanghai girls, war by sebastian junger  movies: i enjoy all types of movies especially comedies, action flicks, drama, and documentaries. one of my favorite documentaries is restrepo.  music: all genres of music suit my taste, but i would have to say my favorite is country music...i know, really, an asian person who like country music...crazy right?  food: sushi family, friends, skiing, shopping, driving my car, and traveling! what new destinations i can travel too next hanging out with friends i guess something private that most people find surprising is that i've got a couple of tattoos you are a goal oriented person who lives an active life style.\n",

      "i really don't like talking about myself...so this is kind of hard. i grew up in a small town humboldt county and moved to the big city 10 years ago. although i've transformed into a \"city guy\" i still like to consider myself a country boy (no, no wranglers, hat or boots...that was when i was a youngin..).  my favorite things to do are watch/play sports (played college basketball/football) and watch theater. other things and i enjoy doing is playing softball, going for long walks, mountain biking, going to the gym, and watching movies (although i haven't done this in a while).  i am smart, funny, and original after a 3 year hiatus, i went back to teaching ms physical education. it's a fun, rewarding, and great to be working with kids again! although this is a fun job, i'm really focusing on going back to school. i have a ma in kinesiology, but hoping to enter a masters or phd program for psychology. not sure if i want to go to school for 2 or 4-5 years...i love learning but it's a long commitment.  i am once again falling in love with going to the gym...not so much for hitting the weights, but cardio and playing hoops....you know..be more active. as part of that active lifestyle, i began salsa dancing (oct. 2011) and love it! its a work in progress and looking forward to the twirls and whirls. :-) cooking, air guitar in my car, telling bad jokes, incorporating movie quotes in my conversations, and striking up conversations with complete strangers. i'm also pretty good at making 80's cd compilations...if there's an 80's tune you enjoy hearing, i probably have it on one of my famous totally 80's mixes. my humor. my best friend says that my humor is a hybrid of george lopez (probably because of my latin background) and jim carey (because i'm somewhat goofy). favorite food: vietnamese, thai, mexicano favorite book: animal farm, where the wild things are favorite music: van halen or ac/dc favorite movies: princess bride, rushmore, the godfather (i & ii), scarface, lord of the rings trilogy, caddyshack, dumb and dumber favorite shows (my own category): seinfeld, arrested development, sportscenter, cheers and anything on the history channel. god my daughters (2) my cell phone music softball internet whats next in my life. i'm about to start the next chapter of my life and am curious to see what it will bring. everything happens for a reason, and some things are not in one's control; you kind of just have to go with the flow and let things happen...but sometimes you have to make it happen. either playing softball, hanging out with friends, watching a movie (during baseball season, i'm at the stadium), or playing soccer with my future soccer stars! i'm scared of heights, but have not always been.... you like bad jokes or humor me when i tell them, like exploring new places (the bay area has tons of untouched places to chill), going to the flea market, or just want to hang out. also, if you're looking for a salsa partner (big plus); beginning i may add. :-)\n",

(is that too many hats?) i like people and i'm pretty friendly and outgoing.  i used to think i was an introvert, but then i took one of those online personality questionnaires (might have been meyers-briggs) and learned that i'm actually an extrovert. i don't know why i thought i was introverted. i'm talkative, outgoing, occasionally funny. but for some reason i thought of myself as being more inwardly focused.  i'm interested in meeting new people and making the world a better place through art and social activism. i'm an artist, so i keep myself busy making images that will inspire and entertain. most days i'm in my studio, making art for posters, young adult book covers and websites. i try to keep my clients happy!  i've recently started teaching at a local art college, and i love being a teacher and mentor to younger artists. they're challenging, often difficult, but it's really a transformative experience.  i also consider myself a lefty activist type. these days i spend less time out in the streets protesting, and more time making artwork for various causes. i stay involved, and there's less risk of arrest!  when i'm not working i'm going out to dinner with friends, meeting people for drinks, or staying home and relaxing with a good book. i'm also one of those people who loves social media, so i'm online a lot looking for interesting items to share.  i'm a skeptic and a critical thinker, but i have recently found that some spiritual practices make me happier. so i do yoga and meditate  my life has vastly improved! i'm also an avid cyclist and i work out when i can.  i'm lucky enough to have family in the bay area, including two nieces and a nephew, so i often see them on weekends. chopping herbs and garlic. (i like repetitive tasks that also require concentration. also: making whipped cream with a whisk. and: licking envelopes. really!) i don't know what they notice  no one ever tells me! but i think i make a positive impression of some sort, because it often happens that people i've only met once seem very happy to see me again. (that can be embarrassing if i have no idea who they are, but thankfully that doesn't happen too often.) robert bolao! michael chabon! don delillo! alice munro! ursula k. leguin! cory doctorow! john berger!  anything by steven soderbergh! dr. strangelove! zombieland! herzog! the squid & the whale! star wars (when i'm feeling sick)!  beirut! devotchka! manu chao! calexico! johnny cash! cat power! sharon jones & the dap kings! x! the xx! the knitters! lucinda williams! neko case! chuck prophet! rykarda parasol! andrew bird! cults! the specials! the clash! elvis costello! gogol bordello!  food: i'm a sushi-holic! i spend way too much money each month on sushi. but what is money for if not raw fish?  my ambition: to see more plays and live performances! my sketchbook! tequilla! my laptop! kalamata olives! chai tea! um... sex? is the world changing for better or worse? (both?) will the arab spring happen here? can neuroscience explain my political choices? which friend will join me for a drink on a weekday evening? am i a genius or an idiot? having dinner with friends, getting an early drink to avoid crowds in the mission, biking with the sf bike party or critical mass, curling up with a book and a movie after a long week. at 43 i have recently bought my first car and my first television. am i selling out? just send the message already!  i should probably say that i take the light-hearted approach when it comes to chatting or meeting up. gotta have a sense of humor right? if you'd like to meet and keep it light and fun, at least at first, then i'd love to hear from you.\n",

      "i'm a curious person, interested in how the world works (mostly people, but okay, motors too). i'm a default extrovert, prone to talking to strangers in public. the secret is simple: ask people about themselves and they'll usually tell you something interesting (i.e. \"cool dog. does he know any tricks?\" or \"where do you eat in this neighborhood?\" ). i'm philosophically-minded, but also pretty silly for a professor.  i grew up a suburban kid in the pre-tech, pre-\"play date\" days, building skateboard ramps and running around town unchaperoned--that is to say a normal, hands-on 70's childhood in a family that's still very close. i have a couple of nice gadgets, but i try to keep daily screen/tech time to a minimum, much preferring coffee with a friend to facebook or whatever.  what else? i have a soft spot for crafters, enthusiasts and people who root for the underdog (not the underdogs themselves--screw them! ha-ha). i'm not your tall-dark-rockhardabs-type romeo, but i'm a fun date, respectful, a good conversationalist, not self-absorbed.  gee, that last one is hard to communicate in a \"self-summary,\" isn't it?! :) for love/money/summers free, i'm an english professor at a local college. i'm also pretty active socially/creatively and travel quite a lot. at the moment i'm just coming down from a trip to argentina, doing some sculptural welding at the crucible in oakland and tile work on my bathroom. i spend a lot of time with my nieces & nephews, too. i'm basically a soccer uncle. making pancakes active listening home repair/handyman stuff juggling entertaining children speaking in fake foreign accents charades forgetting people's names skipping rocks hmmm, couldn't really say...if i happen not to be wearing shoes, it would definitely be my toes, which descend in a perfect line, biggest piggy to the smallest.  a lot of my students say i sound like kevin spacey. books: anything by tobias wolff, alain de botton, c.s. lewis, kurt vonnegut, milan kundera, gabriel garcia marquez, or flannery o'connor. a separate peace, their eyes were watching god, the brothers karamozov, lolita, heart of darkness, grapes of wrath, beloved, etc. in non-fiction i liked devil in the white city, freakonomics, the glass castle, the art of loving. i'm one of few straight men i know who read eat, pray love.  movies: harold and maude, the royal tenenbaums, the godfather, cinema paradiso, most coen brothers, spaghetti westerns, shawshank redemption, amelie, almodovar, etc.  don't watch a ton of tv, but shows i've liked: mad men, six feet under, firefly, the west wing. someone has to explain reality shows to me.  music: i was raised by hippies, so gravitate towards acoustic stuff--james taylor, the civil wars, mumford and sons, eddie vedder. i also love irish-inspired tunes (the pogues/flogging mollie) + tenacious d. family (and friends--\"god's apology for family\" ha ha!) sushi the new yorker public radio music books how to make my grape nuts tastier, and how a loving god can allow suffering in the world. :)  whatever michael krasny has been talking about that morning. building a california mission out of sugar cubes. did anyone else do that in school?! :0 seriously...probably i'm out to dinner/movie with friends, or maybe some french conversation meetup. who knows? \"typical\"? okay, full disclosure: i play in a nine-piece ukulele band. if i just lost you, have a nice life! you also like these qualities: warmth, curiosity, irony without excessive cynicism, authenticity. teasing and being teased (playfully). you're drawn to the idea of having a family some time (soon-ish?).\n",

      "how to self-summarize?! i'm a csu hayward graduate, b.a. in communications. i am a photographer specializing in school photography, weddings, portraits, and automotive. i do photography for a living, so it's a huge part of my life right now. i like to try out new things, learning to play the guitar right now. i'm always on my computer reading up on things, working in photoshop and lightroom.  the computer is my source of movies, tv, and networking (facebook and aim mostly). i watch alot of tv shows, 24, lost, ghost whisperer, csi, law and order svu, entourage, how i met your mother, numb3rs, the office, weeds, family guy, to name a few (hehe). keep moving into my photography work, surround myself with all that is good, learn more about god, eat enough food to make a small country envy. traveling is something i don't do right now, so when the timing comes, i want to travel to places like western europe, south america, china, japan. even within the u.s., i want to go to hawaii, las vegas for pleasure (each time i go it's for business, i want to walk around without a schedule and see where things take me, all i need is a couple of days and a buddy, and we'll have the best of times), new york, and washington d.c.. over thinking things, and replaying things in my head. i quote alot of things i hear, mostly tv related. i been told to have an internal gps and good sense of direction. i'm a shy person at once, but i open up when i'm comfortable. so if you want me to keep things to myself, don't open that door. but the other side of that door is quite amazing! i don't read enough to have favorite books.  i enjoy all sorts of movies, some of the ones i love are forrest gump, saving private ryan, all lord of the rings, star trek (all except the first one), all star wars, and the most recent, forgetting sarah marshall.  i got a crazy mix of music interest, from hip hop, country, pop, to foreign songs that i don't even understand but love the tempo or vocals. i have no favorite singer or band or group that i must listen to, but if i had to say some names, jason mraz, black eyed peas, girls aloud, vanessa carlton, and kenny g, but really it's how i feel and what lyrics makes sense at the moment.  as for food, i love trying new things, but i enjoy mostly italian, japanese (sushi!), chinese, and mexican (la pinata!). 1. a camera 2. a computer 3. food 4. a warm bed 5. a pillow and blanket with that warm bed 6. a good conversation that covers many many topics where's work going to take me, how's my family going to be in another 5-10 years as i get older, who's the person i'm going to focus my attention on.  i like analyzing photography, how the lighting is, what camera settings were used, what was done to capture the shot, how's the expression of the subject and what defines the essence of it that makes it powerful. having dinner with friends, preferably at a new restaurant that none of us have tried. or, having a few drinks at a lounge or tiki bar. or, just fellowship with friends. been single all my life. i don't enjoy it, so those people out there that become single, don't soak in it, get back out there because i think being with someone emotionally and physically is incredible! for some odd reason, every life's situation can be related to an episode or scene on 'friends'. so if you can relate to that, we pretty much are going to be on the same page.\n",

      "i am not much into talking about myself on this thing.. the best way to get to know who i am is to message me and chat with me :) i will say that i feel i have been put on this earth to help and create positive energy to either people in need or just to make amazing experiences with great people. i try to stay positive and make every moment count. i am outgoing, goofy and usually unpredictable.. haha not in a bad way. ok.. don't be afraid to send me a message. :) currently working full time and living in san mateo. i enjoy what i do. i am a personal stylist at nordstrom and am a private personal trainer/fitness instructor. i do the training on the side because i just enjoy that better than working at a gym for the time being. i also just love helping people reach a goal that may be too hard for them to get to on their own, or they just need the extra push. i go out here and there and feel i have a pretty good balance between relaxed and crazy. i love going out to dinner. visiting new places, restaurants, and just sitting and having good conversation. making people laugh. crazy sense of humor. people say my eyes. that i am straight forward and my own person. i love to listen books wise.. that's tough, i really have been meaning to get into more books. lately i haven't been reading much but health and fitness books. i used to read all the stephen king books i could get my hands on. i love description. i did read every goosebumps books ever written back in hs hahaha  movies, i love comedy of course, i will watch and actually enjoy a chick movie here and there. love suspense. i think that's just one of the things i love to do, watch movies. glass of wine and a good flick. sounds like a great night to me.  shows.. i have gone to a decent amount of shows, being from a small town you don't get to many big names coming to your area. haha. i have seen muse twice, very good! tool, nin, steve miller band (which was fun) i have gone to numerous music events back in the day for work. i love all types of music, so i would be willing to try any new show that comes along.  i just flat out love music. i know this is feeling like a term paper here. \"a few music group that i enjoy are....\" hahaha. no, but i played a few instruments when i was younger. sax, piano, a little drums. i feel i can hold a tune. i pretty much will try most all music for a while.. i can't only take so much screamer music at once before i wanna jump off a cliff, but its ok. rap is a mixed bag for me. i like it sometimes, but it may be too much for me too. i just don't like the lyrics sometimes and it gets annoying that there are grown men grunting in the background and saying \"what\" or \"huh\" all the time. why are they even there?? haha. moral support? i like 90s rock, 80s music, even blue grass. i could go on forever, so i will stop there.  food needs its own website. i love food! i love almost all types. i'll be quick about thing. if i had to choose a few things that i could have everyday. sushi, thai, ice cream, and we will say.... cheese! i love cheese. anything with cheese on it. totally not an emotional eater... can you tell? haha. no.. i am willing to try anything. i love to attempt to cook new things and love to go to restaurants. ok.. thats enough for now.. have to have something to talk about over dinner ;) haha. air haha jk... well not really laughter eye contact cheese sex acts of being spontaneous adventure food ... i know that's eight.. the next step/adventure i want to peruse in life. where/what i am going to eat next. honestly... lately i have been pretty relaxed. i have been home, watching a movie or something like that. last friday i went out and had some drinks with my roomies and went out to the driving range and hit golf balls while under the influence, now that was entertainment haha. i am down to do anything though, just lately been kind of a bum about it. hmmmm... i am going to have to get back to you on this one.. i am an open book, but i just can't really think of anything. you saw something in all that mess of a profile i put together that resonates with your life. i am down to meeting people for all types of reasons, not just to be with me. but obviously i feel that's part of the goal for this kinda site. haha  oh. haha and just so everyone knows.. that \"less independent\" thing on my profile is a load of crap hahah. just sayin.\n",
      "let's see... a little about myself... how does the saying go?... \"my friends would say i'm:\" goofy, fun, witty, genuine, a smartypants, a wee bit of a music snob and just a plain and simple nice girl... the kind of girl your friends would think was pretty cool and your family would probably love.  things you might want to know about me: i have an insane sweater collection. really, it borders on the disturbing. i'm kinda a big hockey fan. ok, not just kinda. :) i love writing but am strangely protective of it to the point that i rarely share it with anyone. so if you ask, the answer is probably going to be \"no\"... sorry. i play around with photography but i hesitate to say i'm great. i think it's pretty ok. but i *will* share that with you if you ask. i love cold, rainy weather and would generally prefer being in the mountains to sitting on a beach somewhere (blame being born in washington... it's in my blood!). definitely love traveling and want to see as much of this world while i'm fortunate to be on it. i'm a big history nut. seriously. big. (although i'm most fascinated with the time between the roman empire thru the renaissance). majored in medieval studies in school. yes, it's actually a major. along those same lines, i adore period costume. i do love me some corsets! i've been to the renn. faire once or twice in my day, but surprisingly enough, it wasn't my scene... not that i think i even really have a \"scene\"... i kinda blend in wherever i am.  as far as what i look for in a guy, ideally he would be intelligent, driven, curious, passionate, adventuring, hilarious and hopefully share a lot of my interests while still having his own that he can teach me about. if he were also a hockey fan, that would be fabulous. nothing beats chemistry though. he could be all those things and more, but without chemistry, it doesn't matter much, does it.  i am laid-back, sarcastic, and imaginative i'm an admin. at a local commercial bank.  other than that, to quote the mcconaughey, \"you just gotta keep livin', man. l-i-v-i-n.\" writing, cribbage (a dying art, i tell ya!), crafty-type stuff, trivia games, making mix cds, sarcasm, making people feel comfortable, daydreaming, tripping over my own feet, giving hugs, getting sunburned.  things i'm not very good at: math, being aggressive (but i'm working on it!), using chopsticks (many have tried to teach me and all have failed), doing shots, lighting matches. i'd say it's probably my red hair. after that, it would probably be my snarky, sarcastic sense of humor. (a) mists of avalon and any of the other marion zimmer bradley books, almost any arthurian legend, shakespeare, chaucer, rutherfurd, binchy, swerling, travel guides...  (b) la confidential, american beauty, napoleon dynamite, nacho libre, silence of the lambs, marie antoinette, love actually, casablanca, austin powers, borat, memento, zoolander, goonies, psycho, rear window, garden state, trainspotting, high fidelity, much ado about nothing, elizabeth, princess bride, empire records, bottle rocket, royal tenenbaums, sunset boulevard, and many more...  (c) the cure, tori amos, smashing pumpkins, tea party, pearl jam, muse, a fine frenzy, the radio dept., the big pink, death cab for cutie, chris isaak, enya, loreena mckennitt, john mayer, a perfect circle, doves, joy division, trash can sinatras, siouxsie and the banshees, the smiths, stone roses, bjork, the jam, rolling stones, creedence clearwater revival, fleetwood mac, frank sinatra, dean martin, johnny mathis, etc...  (d) i just like food in general. but anything you can do with potatoes and/or tomatoes, i'm sure i'll love. practical answer: air, food, water, shelter and some money. so that's five, oh well. my not so practical but no less essential list would include: some form of caffeine, a sweater, my ipod, my camera, a computer (although i still debate this one), and dr. pepper chapstick. where to go on my next big vacation... lately, my friday nights have been quietly spent at home watching movies... but that's only because i need at least one night to decompress and gear up for the rest of the weekend! i like odd numbers better than even. you've read a good portion of this profile and something i wrote made you smile/laugh/think/nod/ponder/wonder and/or appreciate.  that, or i looked at your profile and was probably too shy to contact you. :)\n",

      "turns out i've led a very similar life to will smith:  in west st. louis born and raised on the computer where i spent most of my days chillin' out, maxing, relaxing all cool and all hittin' tennis balls outside of the school when a couple of pixels who were up to no good started making trouble in my photoshop i wrote one little program and my mom got scared she said \"you're movin' with your macbook and wacom to purdue\"  okay, i know what you're thinking.... i should stick to gangster rap. \"rolling the hard six.\" i recently left my job as an engineering manager at a cupertino fruit company to embark on creating my own software business. my company is focused on making great tools for graphic designers. i like to flex different talents, so my role is programming, designing, arting, marketing, and everything in between. there's nothing else i'd rather be doing. being a game changer. opening doors. winning at euro board games then rubbing it in. why don't you tell me? books prefer non-fiction. i just got done reading rachel maddow's drift and am moving on to insanely simple.  podcasts this american life, skeptics guide to the universe, history of rome (i'm proud to say i've listened to all 180 episodes), astronomy cast.  movies the fifth element, lawrence of arabia, gandhi, samurai fiction, gangs of new york, 007, west side story, goldeneye, annie hall, clerks, airplane.  shows hbo: game of thrones, curb your enthusiasm, sopranos, entourage, rome. science-ish: doctor who, battlestar galactica, star trek, wonders of the solar system, the day the universe changed, cosmos. others: daily show, colbert, seinfeld, sherlock i also have seen my share of anime.  music [hipster voice]you probably haven't heard of them.[/hipster voice]  food i'll try anything (proof: i've eaten raw chicken). fuel is japanese izakaya food, yakitori, ramen, or tonkatsu. i'm a fan of spicy thai curries, bone-in ribeye steaks, raw fish, and arm-dripping peaches. 1. a problem to solve 2. my mac and iphone 3. wifi; quality of life is directly proportional to bandwidth 4. kosher corned beef on rye 5. my shinai (bamboo sword for kendo) 6. a pencil, paper, and some ideas struggling vines. art. the universe. food. products. simplicity. you. - catching up with friends over food and wine - pursing creative endeavors or cooking up some new software - out drinking at my friend's office hours (okay, maybe that's a wednesday thing) - watching sherlock gotta keep some mystery ;-) you can close your eyes and touch your finger to your nose on the first try.\n",
      "thoughtful, responsible, visually-attuned father, interested in finding some playful companionship, inspiration, and a little tenderness (from someone closer to my own age). things are running smoothly over herejust missing that feeling. on the lookout for beauty and simplicity. seeking quality and contentment. listening cheese omelets (according to the lad) avuncular advice (only when asked) cutting things up and putting them back together wandering my honest face (i try not to abuse this) oh, i don't know, much of what is created by those who care i suppose. i do make an effort though to avoid most of popular american culture. (i did enjoy the british television advertising awards 2010 a few weeks ago!) a camera warm water the boy, of course novelty my red-handled knife being outside spatial relationships, luxury hotels, breathing eating tacos or catching up i'm not as hip as i once thought i was. would like to be appreciated by a simple, intelligent man.\n",

i'm warm and welcoming. i'm currently a student at the university of san francisco. i was studying to go to med school, but i changed my mind and switched to english with a history minor.... i know, polar switch... lol. but yeah i'm taking a semester off to work and save up some money. nothing big, just a minimum wage job to fill time and put money in the bank till summer classes start again. i'm planning... well... discussing an existential adventure to find my friends aunt who disappeared off the face of the earth in her search for the meaning of life. seriously. im leaving next summer and letting the world take me to where i need to go. ^-^ i'm really good at playing music and writing lyrics. i've been doing it for a long time. i'm also a really good glover, not to toot my own horn there but i have been told so :p. i am a good cook and love trying out new recipes. the first things people usually notice about me are my smile, and my eyes. i'm not conceited, i've just heard it enough to not be uncomfortable with it. books: infinite jest, the trial, a portrait of the artist as a young man, as i lay dying, the mysterious flame of queen loana, death of a salesman, dante's divine comedy, heart of darkness, frankenstein, etc... i love poetry too. yeats, ginsburg, and t.s. eliot are my favorites.  movies: i love a well made film. i'm not picky about genres as long as the film is well made. i am fond of horror, indie films, thrillers, and sci fi though. right now my favorites are john carpenters the thing, reservior dogs, fight club, and eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.  shows: i havent been watching a lot of tv lately but i used to watch a ton of anime. like more than is socially acceptable. :p i love parks and rec, south park, boondocks, doctor who, battlestar galactica, the wire, breaking bad, how i met your mother, friends, and seinfeld.  music: i'm a music geek. its kind of my life. i listen to pretty much everything. indie, rock, alternative, reggae, punk, emo-core, ambient, country, rap, electronica and everything else i forgot its safe for you to assume i listen to it. i am obsessed with electro though, trance, happy hardcore, hardcore, dubstep, drum & bass, house, fidget house. im a huge raver. i glove and all that jazz, and im pretty damn good at it. if i had to name some of my favorites i would say: interpol, mgmt, alkaline trio,

mayonaise. :| but ya i love all foods equally and am not afraid to try new things. my favorite by far is mexican food though. the six things i could never do without go like this. 1. my music. i can't imagine life without it. it makes my life what it is and me who i am. 2. my friends. they take care of me like a family and i love them like one. 3. my guitars. i don't know what i would do if i didn't have the ability to play guitar or bass. i have been for 10 years and a musicians life isn't complete without them. 4. my books. i read for pleasure and to educate myself. the great writers of history are great for a reason and they deserve to be experienced. i cant imagine not having books to read. 5. good food. i love to eat. especially things that taste great. if i had to eat bland food forever i would loose my mind. 6. my turntables. i spin and mix music every day to relax and to record remixes of great tracks. it allows me to get my creativity out when i'm not playing my instruments. i spend a lot of time thinking about philosophy, philosophy, oh.. philosophy, and sometimes philosophy, literature, music friends, and introspective stuff. i tend to day dream way to much. and meditate a lot. (i can't say too much. i don't think its possible to meditate too much). on a typical friday night i'm out partying with my friends in san francisco. usually getting into some sort of trouble. not really super private, but i have five peircings, and one tattoo on my ribs. planning to get more tattoos and maybe my lip peirced when i have the money. if you want to discuss the meaning of life. any of the intricacies of the universe or aspects of the human condition. anything philosophical. if you want to discuss buddhism. if you like food. if your funny. if you meditate. if you want someone to meditate with. if your interested in culture boundary disillusionment. if you like travel. if you like to read. if you don't like to read. if you have piercings and/or tattoos.

      "this is the best time of my life! i have a great job, house, friends, toys, family, and i truly believe it's only going to get better.  read the following all in one breath, it's funnier that way... :d i tried at college and wasn't interested enough to complete it - i found myself always focusing on my profession more. as a kid, i rode bmx with my friends and played with lego all day. i smoked my first cigarette in the 4th grade but never became a smoker. i moved out of my house in texas when i was 14 and went to live at a tennis academy and travel with the wilson tennis team. i quit tennis when i was 18 and decided not to play in college. i began building my first company in texas which eventually introduced me to some guys here in cali who started a company during the mortgage boom. i'm not a big fan of social networking sites; i think the internet has more potential than tweeting, facebooking and digging. i work closely with software engineers at google to help shape their enterprise app suite (gcal, gmail, gdocs, etc etc.) for genentech.  i am also the founder of a small consulting company that brings the best mac os x experience to the television. www.clusterboxconsulting.com it's small so far, but people who have seen the product think big things are ahead. (fingers crossed. :) computers. i'm a geek but with good one-on-one social-skills. i could probably fool the average person into thinking i know nothing about computers if i had to. if the stars are not aligned correctly and i'm in at a large party it's possible for me to be really reserved... other times i can walk into a party and everyone cheers.. it's weird. like i said it depends on how the stars are aligned. i'm really good at sports or anything athletic and wish i gave myself more time to exercise and play sports again. *new years resolution epiphany i'm tall and i wear glasses. - the curious incident of the dog in the night time. - born on a blue day - i hope they serve beer in hell. - shawshank redemption - stand by me - sushi - expensive red meat - fettuccine alfredo movies, sleep, party-time, a job, a best friend. i'm always wondering where myself, friends and family will be in 10 years. i wonder about software implementations and \"why nobody ever thought that\", and that my battery life cannot be accurately estimated but i can tell you when some smart guy's satellite will finally reach orbit. i wonder what other people think about me too much. i wonder when i will find the time to travel around the world. i wonder if i can afford that? kickin' life in the face. probably jammin' to some super-phat loud music that my grandma wouldn't approve of, and tapping on both my iphones. the next friday night i am curled up on the couch and watching that movie that hasn't been released in the states yet. an ex-girlfriend got me a job selling women's clothing for a few months and i was damn good at it! you want to meet a nice guy who will treat you well and with respect, but also knows how to get in some trouble every now and then... oh yeah, \"my apartment smells of rich mahogany and i have many leather bound books.\" do you know that quote? if so, message me. :d don't cheat on the googles now. i don't like cheaters.  update: sex can wait. i'm truthfully looking forward to laughing, adventuring, learning from, lightly arguing with (while grinning at the same time), meeting new circles of people, and having that certain someone actually pop in my head and disrupt my concentration when i'm at work.

      "[update 6-28-12]: i've had some awesome conversations but i need to take a break and do more writing. for those truly interested in continuing conversations about creativity, find me at my eponymous blog. slinte! [end update] if you get no farther than this: despite having a strong interest in science, i am an enfp, for those who care and make note of such.  i have a weakness for girls with a sharp mind and a sharp wit, and can fence with both.  i have an insatiable creative streak, most of which gets channeled through writing and photography, though i'm also working on an ios game and in search of someone who can draw better and faster than i do.  i like to dance. i love to snuggle. when i travel, i love to take photos, people watch, and really soak in the culture. actually, i do that even in the bay area. i take my time when looking at artwork. i'm extremely tech savvy but can grow awesome tomatoes. i read everything from history and anthropology to mystery/thrillers and scifi, the latter of which i've always intended to write but my first novel is turning out to be a wwii mystery.  i love the fog or a storm on a rocky coast as much as the sunshine.  learning is a lifetime pursuit for me and i have numerous lectures from the teaching company and love itunes u. every now and again i work on learning the piano but am usually stumped by a defect in reading music, though i have learned a few simple tunes by ear. singing-wise, i can carry a tune but the bucket sloshes.  i love to get down into the dirt to plant or play but i'm not \"down-to-earth\"; i am a dreamer, it's how i make my living and i work hard to make those dreams a reality both for myself and my kids. being a dreamer did not prevent me from sending each to the university of their choice, rather it made it possible. they are currently working in fields they love, surrounded by friends and loved ones. john barrymore said, \"a man is not old until regrets take the place of dreams.\" i have no regrets.  home is wherever we are and whatever we do. i want to be with someone who feels like home, even if we're in the most remote part of the world. making it happen and loving it. figuring things out. love puzzles. also gingerbread pancakes, from scratch, usually organic and topped with vermont maple. and yes, i'll share the recipe. i borrowed the basis from a defunct restaurant in burlington. my smile? my eyes? the fact that i look very intently at the person talking to me. it may seem like staring but it's because i'm fascinated. for music i mostly listen to alternative rock with classical when writing, a lot of which is what is called cardio classic. i love pandora for its music discovery. i have one custom station named gimmee bowling for cat fish soup which comes from the names of the groups added to it. and another called alternapop. locally, i like kits, live 105.  books tend to run to the sf or mystery/thriller: hiaasen, gaiman, stirling, martin, sandford, f paul wilson, justin cronin. also history, anthropology and richard dawkins.  movies run the gamut, too: from romantic comedies and pixar to action flicks, as well as documentaries and foreign films, like amelie. i have been called a media slut.  on tv, it's character-driven shows and quirky or geeky comedies. and pretty much the whole hbo line-up past and present with current favorites being boardwalk empire, true blood (waaaay better than the books) and game of thrones. something to write on/with. my pup. something to read. camera. my apple eco-system friends, with chocolate. okay, now i'm thinking about a new study showing that beer, wine, honey and chocolate are endangered by climate change. so we can be hot, up to our asses in water and have nothing to take the edge off. a world w/o chocolate and wine? but i'm stilling thinking about dialogue: internal, external, true and fictional, current events, the latest science news, or tech gossip, and how i can work that into what i'm doing. and you. it is the truest of connections that drives my expression, so i wonder where my muse is and what new worlds you have to reveal. visiting with friends or watching a movie at home. i'd be out dancing but haven't found the right partner yet. is i would be lost without a spell checker. my im devices are set for autocorrect, which yes can have it's own problems but when i start typing at speed my fingers can become dyslexic. you have a good sense of humor and self, a love of life-time learning, think holding hands and kissing is ageless, and if especially if you think you can further ignite my creativity as that would be a partnership for the ages.  ps: my politics run decidedly progressive and if you believe that drudge, newsmaxx, worldnet and fox are news outfits we won't be a good match.\n",

      "so, here we go...i have a lovely life--wonderful friends, loving family, great home--but i am looking to meet someone and build a life together.  i worked hard in my 20's to establish my career and had lots of \"me\" time, and i'm now ready to start making \"we\" time. i realize that sounds cheesy, but heck, it's true.  i'm looking for a guy that is either jewish, or willing to (eventually) raise kids as reform or conservative jews. this was an important part of my upbringing, and i want to pass it on to the next generation.  in case you hadn't already realized this, i'm a direct/cut-to-the-chase kind of person. if you like that, keep reading! i'm working towards a masters in digital archiving and recordkeeping, and i'm a marketing/social media consultant. (yeah, i know, it's a crazy transition. loved marketing and pr in my twenties, not so much now.) love the freedom of consulting and working in my pj's, but i miss group health insurance and vacation days. i'm still figuring out exactly how i want to proceed once i get my degree, but i think i'm on the right track, which feels awesome.  in my free time, i think about where i'd like to travel next. went to australia in 2009 and loved it. i'm a hot weather-loving person, so anywhere tropical and sunny gets a thumbs-up from me.  i've had a lot of caretaker duties to deal with over the past few years, due to all sorts of fun family and friend stuff. but that seems to be behind me (with good outcomes, thank goodness). love my family, but it's good to finally have some 'me' time. spending lots of time with friends these days: having long talks about the good and bad elements of being \"grown-up;\" checking out interesting restaurants, movies, and bookstores; and discussing what a crazy and unique time we live in. i'm loyal and direct with friends and family, sometimes to a fault. i'm a pretty good cook and gardener. i'm the cool aunt to my two nephews and niece, all of whom i adore.  and i'm constantly trying to figure out how to survive as a lefty in a right-handed world. it's harder than you might think... i'm short, and i have a quiet voice, so it's easy to miss me. and i'm more of a listener/analyzer than a talker, unless i have a strong opinion on a specific topic. books: my background is in publishing, and i've always been an avid reader. so i read, a lot. some favorite authors include: christopher moore, luis alberto urrea, cormac mccarthy, philip roth, doug copeland, and barbara kingsolver. but this is only the tip of the iceberg.  favorite tv shows/movies: hard to choose...but the wire, oz, dexter, breaking bad, mad men, and america's test kitchen are my favs. i gave up cable tv a few years back, and thanks to a few decent network shows, tivo, hulu, and netflix, i'm plenty entertained. hmmm...movies...loved jaws, shaun of the dead, clerks, any cheesy 80's-style horror/zombie movie, pretty much anything from pixar and/or hayao miyazaki. not a big fan of the rom/com or action genres, unless they have a really unique angle.  food: love pretty much everything but indian and thai foods. but i'm always willing to try out new restaurants and have my beliefs challenged. sushi, chinese, and ethiopian are probably my top 3 favorites.  music: i like most types of music: country, rap, jazz, classic rock, house. it's totally dependent on my mood. my ipod collection is, to put it nicely, schizophrenic. 1. good company  2. sage advice from friends and family  3. sunglasses  4. a good book  5. my android smartphone. yeah, i'm addicted, i admit it.  6. altoids. you never know when you'll need 'em! was going back to school the right decision?  how this recession/depression is going to affect our generation--what are we going to be like in 40 years?  why are people flaky?  what should i cook for dinner?  why are sf residents so unwilling to leave their city? having a relaxing night at home, or at a friend's house for a mellow dinner. 9am boot camp class means that i can't go too crazy friday night. i prefer to go out on thursday and saturday instead. my username may not mean what you think it means. you're looking to meet someone in real life, not just online. and, of course, if you think we'd make a good match!\n",

      "i guess it's supposed to be cool now to be a nerd. i went through all that as a small kangaroo when that certainly wasn't the case. now i'm uncommonly charming, but that's gone out of style. i never got a fair shake- i was never the nerd or not a nerd at the right time. i don't understand the universe. i don't understand the principles by which it does things. i don't argue.  i live in san francisco, i work in silicon valley. i hang around the mission quite a bit, saturday nights maybe not so much. it's like all bros named chad from the horrible marina. and this also, said marlow suddenly, has been one of the dark places of the earth.  i think it's still best to go out to see movies.  i know you want beards, but my shaving schedule doesn't extend beyond a few days to let it happen. sorry, i can grow a crazy beard better than anyone, but it's not good for my image at this point. if you want me to grow one because you jumped on that train, i have one condition for you as well.  that leads me to the overall lack of style going on these days- i can't believe i'm expected to fall for girls in giants/raiders/a's jerseys and ballcaps and north face jackets as their best effort, like badly dressed dudes in cargo shorts and mandals. i can't with confidence tell the difference any more about which sex is dressed worse.  you don't see photos of me skydiving, rock climbing, hangliding over a volcano, bike riding to the top of mount everest or backpacking on the moon because i'm not really into any of that. about 70 percent of the profiles i see have at least one photo implying the person is a very outdoorsy type, but i'm not sure if all lot of this is played up because it's commonly assumed everyone else is very very outdoorsy, too.  despite it all, i'm still a bro. no, i mean i'm not a bro. don't get that confused.  teasing my good pals and laughing at each others' expense are fair game. i only tease the lucky ones- if i didn't like someone i wouldn't even do it. generally though, i laugh big, and i laugh last. watch it, mac. teaching myself electric guitar, single handedly holding off the statistics for male pattern baldness. i may save the human race from its genetic failings yet. spending time with pals, learning how to be a villain from said pals. definitely not collecting baseball cards or in a fantasy football league. weekend travel plans when work allows it (or requires it). frozen juice bars in the summer. resisting the ironic lumberjack beard thing, which i suppose is a bad move these days, but, meh... doing impressions. listening, talking. the dance floor. explanations for the absurd. picking out outfits and dressing us both. driving- never had a ticket. catching fire. eating out. planning robot attack waves. cutting my own hair. sarcasm. teasing. explosive power and dynamo reflex action. muscles. my cheeks get squeezed alot, and if i'm wearing my tie, mesmerized people start playing with it

      "the masculine point of view continues to fascinate me. have you read the way of the superior man' or 'dear lover' by d. deida? maybe you are familiar with his writing. both men and women invariably want the same things, but we dance to a different step. our paths converge; there can be apprehension, intrigue or hot passion, with one necessary ingredient: chemistry. please stop reading if - you're not willing to jump in with both feet and your heart, to start a journey together. . . . and/or you're 40 yrs and younger. (you are definitely fun. . . i am just on a different path.)  although i am as physically interested in connecting, these photos are just a glimpse into who i am. i want the depth, those special memories, knowing that love is not given, if we are fortunate to experience it together! i'd like to experience an ongoing quality meaningful relationship. as life unfolds i've realized it's more about appreciating the process and less about a destination. life is so yummy, starting a new chapter with children in college; i am in lust with my free time.  and something else is delicious . . . skin to skin. sex is an important part of a relationship. looking into your eyes, seeing what you want, you need, i need it too.  please don't interpret my photos to imply that i am promiscuous, quite the opposite. my intention here is simple, if i meet a person who is honest, understanding, trusting, adventurous and open, i want to focus on just him, to see where it goes. i've met someone here, maybe he is the one, maybe not? being selective, knowing that finding a special connection is a process and not a destination, i relish in this process. connecting with someone who wants to share a journey together that we can define. soaking in those moments of pleasure, openness, harmony, and blissfulness that two people on the same journey can truly appreciate.  so what else am i doing? experiencing the path, the ebb and flow of each day, meeting new people, and i love the outdoors. at 123 lbs., i'm energetic, well-educated, attractive, positive, passionate, and happy to spend time cycling, kayaking, running, hiking, volleyball, or hitting the weights several times a week. practicing vinyaya and bikram-love yoga, dancing-love-love to try new steps, venturing from salsa to tango, would you like to practice with me? i'm not concerned about what others think, i'm just me. i'm really good at showing you who i am. it's important for you to just be yourself. i'm open to trying new things with you, surfing? skydiving? suggestions?  the diversity of the bay is amazing. i'm grateful to live here. over the past four years traveling has been one of my priorities. i've had the opportunity to experience spain, france, germany, the netherlands, italy, brazil and mexico. are you passionate about traveling? at this moment with a glass of wine, candles lit, soft music (love pandora) i reflect. our profiles might match 80% or 99%, but if both of us aren't willing to take a chance and meet, how will it start? with our past experiences and knowledge, i see one key question: how do we travel this path-our connection- at the same pace?  this profile was created to avoid the bs, leaving preconceived ideas about relationships outside the box, not allowing society to dictate what type of connection we want. alluring, vivacious, and more than happy to share photos with you.  i'm passionate, creative, wildly imaginative, and simple with deep currents. traveling, experiencing the world, new cultures and warm water, i am addicted. let's plan a trip together, i love jumping on a plane. exploring a new city or hiking to the edge of the forest for a breath taking view and inhaling the warm pine fragrance. living life to the fullest! making connections and enjoying all of the people i've met, loving my friends and family, looking forward to those i've yet to meet in my life, and enjoying this dating process.  i just became addicted to \"words with friends and hanging with friends\" which is as close to a video game as i get. well. . . except wii bowling and i have tried the bass guitar a few times. being motivating, creating fun, smiling, and being silly! ok, i am being modest. maybe you should tell me????

      "i was born and raised massachusetts, so i'm an asshoe. you don't have to like cats, just my cats. i ride a bicycle. his name is bartleby, he is not neutered. if you tip less than 20%, don't waste your time reading on. i don't need to drink to have a good time, i just have a good time drinking. i talk, a lot. i pee in the shower. i pick my nose. i'll more than likely make you smell my arm pits. i wash my hair once, maybe twice a week. i don't wash thrift store clothes before i wear them. cut off jean shorts weather is my favorite. i enjoy drinking and napping in parks. i own cats but want to steal your dog. if you're scared of pitbulls, i probably won't like you. i am not a burner. i enjoy sarcasm and being made fun of. i'm inappropriate and openly disgusting. i can be offensive. i think everyone looks better in a sleeveless shirt. i enjoy ridiculous tattoos. men who dance well make my heart skip a beat. my vocabulary consists of an over whelming amount of profanity. oh and i almost forgot, hail satan. slinging beer and wings to pay for my direction-less life style. being creepy. my red hairs. anything by kurt vonnegut makes me feel warm inside.  i watch comedy and zombie movies. i especially like the combination of the two.  if i watch tv seinfeld, always sunny, the league, and law & order consume my time in front of it.  i listen to queen, lil wayne, the knife, at the drive-in, justice, converge, howl, anberlin, jay z, brand new, chromeo, or anything with good beats.  i have a very irish diet, mostly meat and potatoes. family / friends. my cats. a cellular iphone. money, clothes, and hoes. what i'm going to eat for my next meal. where i'll be drinking for the evening. what happened last night. making dollars that i spend immediately afterwards on getting enough alcohol in me to think my dance moves are killing it. they are though. i love all body hair on men and i'm terrified of spiders. you're a dick. you don't mind that i'm a dick. you're not broke, i don't want your money but i'm not trying to be anyone's sugar mamma.\n",
      "never done this before...  i am intelligent, serious about life, and somewhat intellectual, but like to do active and fun things, too. in that order, i think. i enjoy being around people, mostly in casual settings or doing something laid back. i am also fit and love to laugh and make other people laugh.  i sincerely believe that i am seeking the same fundamental qualities in a mate, and not someone to save me, change me, or someone who needs saving. i am looking for someone who appreciates me and is confident enough in themselves to not be threatened by me or uncomfortable with my frankness.  it would be nice if we were similar enough to avoid conflicts on the \"majors\" such as money, politics and religion (this doesn't mean that there cannot be differences...)  i am serious, funny, and intense i am self employed and therefore have a good deal of freedom and a good deal of responsibility. i believe that for the most part i have balance between work and non-work, although i lean toward the serious side and will often sacrifice a bit of non-work for work.  i have worked hard for what i have, and want to enjoy the benefits of that freedom and success in a way that fits my moderate personality.  i am active and interested in doing fun things with my mate (and friends), but i am not an adrenaline junkie or thrill seeker, and prefer to have a shower and good night's sleep at the end of a day on the river, hiking, biking, etc.  i think i would rather do lots of things than become excellent at any one to the exclusion of everything else. solving problems in life. probably the way i look (isn't that what we notice about people first?). i am a generalist and like lots of different food, music, etc. i prefer variety over favorites in this area (but not in my love relationships).  that said, i read very little non-fiction because reading for me is my entertainment and escape (i am not a tv watcher). so it's often crime thrillers that i pick up at costco or at airport book stores.  food favorites are basically what's fresh, simple and well prepared, and reasonably healthy. not the extremes, meaning i don't consider fast food \"food\" and could take or leave the fancy, over the top, worlds top ten restaurants. at a restaurant, i will almost always order something i have either never had or never make at home.  not that into music, but i enjoy a little of everthing from classical music performances to the rap played at the gym. go figure. so far i can't think of anything but the obvious things... the people who are important to me.  currently i am thinking about the ways i wish to improve myself. i guess these things come in fits and starts in my life. i would like to practice some of them on a new man :) hanging with friends, or with my mate. i am more interested in being together with people i care about than what we \"do\". i am done with the club scene although i enjoy going out to more mellow venues (live music and theater performances, lectures, restaurants, local watering holes, movies, etc.) is that i am a very private person. on some levels i am very open and can talk about \"sensitive\" things, but my guard is always up to protect myself. some people view this in a negative way (closed, untrusting) but others understand that it is because i am sensitive despite my confidence (i think these are two different things, really). you are kind, intelligent, funny, reasonably fit or somewhat athletic, have varied interests and think that shared experiences between people build the fabric of a lasting relationship. you should be emotionally mature and willing to face and work through the tough times in a relationship.  it would be nice if you are financially secure, as i don't want to be your mommy or your saviour. i am not looking for a meal ticket, either.  i believe i am asking for qualities that i will also bring to the table.  please don't message me if you are an addict or obsessive, broke, kinky, abusive, scared of commitment, are controlling or jealous, needy, unable or unwilling to talk about issues as they arise in a relationship.\n",

      "[please note that i have not updated my profile in a while, aside from tom and me adding links to each other. life updates will occur eventually.]  hi, my name is leigh. i grew up in the bay area, went to oberlin college and conservatory in ohio (bachelor of arts, bachelor of music), and just finished the post-baccalaureate pre-medical program at mills college. the program is for people who already went to college but didn't take the science courses they need to take the mcats and apply to medical school (usually because they were planning to do something else). i still think of myself as a performer, even though it is no longer my main goal in life.  for some reason i always do things the hard way. i think it is because i refuse to participate in mediocrity, and the things i want from life are not for the average person or the faint of heart. i experience the world very intensely and notice the details.  my primary significant other is tommycal, and we've been seeing each other for about a year. tom and i are agreeable to open relationships when time permits. on the kinsey scale i am about a 2.5 [0 is completely heterosexual, 6 is completely homosexual].  i am sumptuous, elegant, and expressive i have returned from mcat bootcamp and taken the mcat exam. this was a highly momentous occasion, and i am recovering from the marathon brain-cramming by doing as little as possible before i return to school for a year of biology courses.  the post-bac program was sort of an exercise in torture and i am really glad it is over. gosh leigh, are you sure you want to be a doctor? perhaps i would rather be an opera singer, but we don't always get to have our first choice. unlike many of my pre-med peers, i am not a super science nerd; rather, i am intellectually interested in medicine, disease, and the functions of the body. having studied ways of thinking (as opposed to just things to think) i will be a good communicator, and i have insight from being a patient many times in my life and having a father who is a doctor.  i had the opportunity to perform in west bay opera's production of \"turandot\" in february. i probably should have spent that time studying organic chemistry, but it made me happy to perform. studying chemistry did not make me happy. studying physics gave me irritable bowel syndrome.  i volunteer with a cat rescue group in redwood city, and fostered a shy pair of kitties for about a year. i have also been volunteering at the kaiser oakland pathology department. after my gallbladder surgery in january i was able to go into the grossing lab and poke at my own gallbladder, as well as examine all the stones (which i took home in a jar, and will show you if you like - i can also explain what the gallbladder does and why i don't need mine). i'm really good at listening. this is one of my most useful skills.  i have a wide repertoire of facial expressions.  i learn visually, so my hobbies are mostly visual arts. i took a drawing class in the fall and really enjoyed it.  i am very musical. i hesitate to say \"i'm really good at singing\" since my operatic career did not exactly launch with epic fanfare, but i can say that i know a lot about music and have skills for helping myself and others appreciate the music we listen to.  i'm really good at picking out gifts for other people. for example: my brother is a big sports fan, so i went to the thrift store and bought two shirts and one baseball cap that had sf giants logos on them; i cut out the logo parts, cut the rest of the shirts into squares, and hand-stitched them together to make a pillowcase; then i sewed on tassels, stuffed it with pillow-stuffing from a fabric store, and voila! a giants pillow unlike any the world has ever seen before.  my job with the cat rescue society is titled \"kitty tamer.\" i specialize in social-skills therapy for adult semi-feral or abandoned cats. these are cats who are mistrustful of humans, and sometimes unsure about how to interact with other cats. when i started volunteering, there was a cat named pearl who spent all of her time scrunched behind a piece of furniture in the corner; i spent months contorting my upper body so that i could pet her. in a standard animal shelter, pearl would have been euthanized to make room for new cats, since she was not socialable enough to be adopted right away. pearl and her buddy sylvester lived with me as foster kitties, and their progress was incredible: they started to purr, they slept on the bed... they became full of personality and affection.  i make delicious vodka martinis. i am an active listener, passionate about what i like and don't like, patient, sultry, and intense. i'm independent and content to do things by myself.  i'm curvy, and fairly small. i wear stilettos on all occasions excepting aerobics class. i like to be highly decorated - i am usually wearing more earrings than articles of clothing. i have no weirdnesses about nudity and the body - the first thing i do when i get home is take off my clothes (i have a high internal thermometer and feel hot all the time; strangers walking down the street ask me, \"aren't you cold?\").  i don't believe in talking to fill up space; words are important to me, and i want to choose the right ones. i would much rather appear quiet and articulate than gregarious and unintelligent. however, i am also quite enthusiastic about many things, for which my gentle, quiet nature must be set aside, such as: the unmusical qualities of bad music, people who park their suvs/trucks in compact spaces, and the ever-increasing proportion of drivers who decline to follow \"yield\" signs. as a musician and former music student, it's pretty difficult to list my favorite music. this is an easy topic of conversation for many people because they can generalize about someone's personality by comparing tastes in music. if i were to temporarily participate in personality categorization by popular music genre, i would say that i enjoy alternative rock from the mid-90's through the present where the lead singer can actually sing, and the songs are fairly melodious and sad. i have a solid appreciation for good old-fashioned mo-town, and surrounding oldies therewith.  other music i never get tired of: \"salome\" by strauss; introduction & allegro appassionato, op. 92 by schumann; the third (crazy hard) movements of beethoven's piano sonatas; \"madame butterfly\" by puccini; \"il trovatore\" by verdi; \"trouble in tahiti\" by bernstein; \"jesus christ superstar\" by andrew lloyd webber; \"chicago\" by kander & ebb. i've become a podcast addict of npr's \"this american life.\"  i love to read the newspaper, modern fiction, and any sort of pop-medical/socio-ethnographic non-fiction. i just finished a book on the \"sleeping sickness\" [encephalitis lethargica] that accompanied the pandemic flu of ww1. being a visual learner i really like keeping abreast of the news via the photo-journalism section of the washington post online. i adore reading roger ebert's movie reviews for movies he thought were unusually bad. (i'll read reviews for movies i've never heard of and have no intention to see, just for the delight of ebert's wonderful use of words.)  in my entire life there are very few times that i have read a book a twice. just too many books! so here are some of the items on my bookshelf: \"collapse\" by jared diamond; \"five families: mexican case studies in the culture of poverty\" by oscar lewis (1975); \"under the banner of heaven\" by jon krakauer; the works of toni morrison (in particular, \"the bluest eye,\" her first and perhaps simplest book); \"sirens of titan\" by kurt vonnegut; \"the things they carried\" by tim o'brian, \"the great gatsby\" by f. scott fitzgerald, \"the sound and the fury\" by william faulkner, and \"nickel and dimed\" by barbara ehrenreich. (i got \"nickel and dimed\" as an audio-book to listen to on my drive to san diego - it's such a good book.)  a friend recently turned me on to \"arrested development.\" sometimes it makes me laugh out loud. i watch \"hoarders\" even though it is emotionally distressing. 1. cats. 2. cheese. 3. sunshine.  i have tried to live without these things at one point or another, and it was a miserable disaster. my kitties: cecelia, who is a boy cat and comes from indiana; shadow and leonora, an adult bonded pair that i adopted from the rescue society where i volunteer. i communicate well with cats; i understand their body language. also, what good is life without cats? they are cuddly, playful, intelligent, and furry.  have you ever lived in the midwest or driven through the middle of the country? if so, you have probably experienced the horrific phenomenon of allowing reconstituted cheese-sauce to be an acceptable substitute for real cheese. cheese is my favorite food, and there is no acceptable substitute.  until i lived near lake erie and experienced \"lake effect,\" i had no idea that sunshine was inexorable from my life.  4. me time 5. ripe, juicy fruit 6. pharmaceuticals  i have to have time by myself. that's it.  is it too much to have two food-related items? i am not sure. i love juicy fruit. my favorite fruit is nectarines, followed closely by mangos, melons, lychees and strawberries.  i am a proponent of better-living-through-pharmaceuticals. this is not the dark ages - why do people drink green tea instead of seeing a doctor? i mean, if the green tea works for you that's fantastic, but i'm going to kaiser to see a specialist.  other things up for consideration in this list include:  a bathtub: i think it would be very difficult to live without a bathtub for the rest of my life - i hate getting water in my eyes. my current place in oakland does not have a bathtub, and it makes me sad.  pillows: particularly the kind with synthetic micro-beads in them. i own so many pillows they don't even fit on the bed.  dictionary.com and wikipedia: i like to look things up. religious fundamentalism. the constraints of ignorance - how people can prefer to live in a state of ignorance when the paths out of ignorance are so plentiful, and why they would force ignorance upon their children. i call this \"willful ignorance.\"  why people are so vitriolic about abortion, but not about child abuse or the abominable state of our national foster-care system.  privilege and education. why it makes a difference if you started sat-prep courses in fourth grade. why people are expected to spend at least 300 hours preparing for the mcat. (i am not making that up.) has it occurred to anyone that this testing system is a lot more like a business than a tool for measuring academic preparedness?  a year and a half ago i basically lived with my grandmother to help her recover from a fall, and spent a lot of time observing people at the end of their life. it made me think about the nature of being old, and how our society handles the elderly; their quality of care, government funded institutions and private care facilities. when you are as old as my grandmother, sometimes the people you know just die. how can you make friends when you have to account for the fact that next week they may be dead? now that i am on summer break, every day is friday!  i love going out to dinner and attending classical music concerts. there are enough restaurants and concerts to fill as many nights as i can spare. i like to be able to talk to my date without shouting, so noisy bars/clubs are not appealing to me.  i am also happy staying in, and on many nights you can probably find me listening to an audio-book and folding origami, or cooking myself something with lots of cheese and watching ted talks or streaming documentaries from netflix. for most of my life i had an irrational yet debilitating fear of space aliens. there is an orange tree outside the window of my bedroom in the house where i grew up; for many years, generations of small nocturnal rodents have been enjoying the tree and its fruits, but i was always afraid to look because they might be space aliens.  this fear did not truly go away until my fourth year of college, when i took a semester of astronomy. for anyone who hasn't taken any astronomy or watched the discovery channel, i will summarize the concept of space with some brief, sweeping generalizations: space is huge; everything is very far apart, and although we have developed fancy technology to see things far away in the huge emptiness of space, in general what we have seen thus far are really big balls of gas.  i was also semi-permanently traumatized by \"the exorcist\". when i was young my mind would bring up a frightening image, and there was no way to purge it except turning on the lights. subsequently my nightmares involved finding myself in a dark room and not being able to turn on the lights. ------  since it has now come up several times, i would like to note that i am not interested in having children, now or in the future. i am not sure why this is relevant for people who are just getting to know each other, but some people like to plan ahead. it is within the realm of possibility that i may change my mind, but that seems unlikely. i find infants and small children viscerally repulsive. they violate my personal space on a regular basis. i am attracted to people who are sensitive and articulate.  there is a common notion that upon meeting someone for the first time you need to begin with meaningless chit-chat. i would prefer to share all of the intimate details and copious parenthetical tangents right away.  it would be nice to meet someone who shares my love of performing arts and creative expression, or has a wide-ranging literary repertoire, or even just majored in the humanities, but i am flexible regarding one's favorite activities. i'll try most things once, and often i will try them again several years later to make sure i still don't like them. this is how i discovered cucumbers.\n",
      "i'm like a ball of happy energy trapped in a person. i'm going all pro at school, i.e. i'm a grad student. sometimes i get to teach and other times i have to write papers. most of the time i'm doing research and i'm a sap for liking it.  for fun i like to play ultimate [frisbee], play capoeira, and snowboard. hobbies that get less regular attention include photography and biking to dive bars. besides the things i do for work or my hobbies, i'm good at: getting excited, improvising cocktails, making dance parties happen, making sandwiches, slowly evacuating burning buildings, and organizing things neatly. sometimes i talk too fast, especially when i am excited about the topic. movies: snatch, ghost dog, hero, hot rod, abre los ojos, 500 days of summer, ice age, revolver, yojimbo, and the third & the seventh  shows: mad men, portlandia, coupling, arrested development, jeeves & wooster, and recently getting into big bang theory  food: sandwiches!

but i won't give up searching. if you are looking for the same (long term that leads to marriage in few years), i would like to meet you if you meet what i'm looking for below.  you are attractive and not obese. you think i'm cute. you are honest, straight forward and open just like me. you are mature and sane. you've never been married. you have no kids but do want kids in the future when you are married. i'm not christian, but i also don't believe in divorce because i don't want my future kids to suffer a broken family, i expect the same mindset from you. you are between age of 21~29 you live in sf or near by cities. you don't gamble. you are not alcoholic. you are d/d free. you are not a wild party girl. most important, we are astrologically compatible. this one is equally important with physical attraction, meaning even if i'm physically attracted to you, i won't date you if we are not compatible in personality. which means, i'm sorry if you are aries/year of dragon, cancer/year of goat, capricorn/year of ox.  i'm open minded so i have no ethnicity preference, but bonus if you can speak chinese ^_^  i'm attracted to a girl who share my interest or are willing to learn to appreciate them and get involved, of course i would do the same for her because it shows that you care.  my ideal girl is someone that i can feel that i would do anything for her and knowing that she would do the same for me, i want to marry the girl i love, i'm optimistic ^_^ i'm working toward reaching my goals in life. 1. buy and run a storefront, i don't like to rent and move location. 2. get married in a few years and have a happy family with 2 children (prefer one boy and one girl) 3. i want a centurion card ^_^; j/k brainstorm, giving good advice, build and fix computers, trade stocks. that i'm cute ^_^; then they notice about my maturity level and inteligence.  for you girls out there who are far from perfect (it could vary from drinking problem, smoking cigs, drugs or very unhealthy diet that can lead to heart disease or diabetes), let me give you some advice on how to tell if a guy truely love you or he's just after your physical appearance and pleasure.  the guy who let you do whatever you want: he doesn't care about you and don't look out for your best interest, he's after you for pleasure.  the guy who nag at you, treats you like his daughter when it comes to bad habits you have, you would feel like he is as annoying as your dad: he truely loves you, because he cares about your well being and look out for your best interest, it takes alot of efforts to try change you especially if you don't listen, it's very stressful and emotionally depressing.  people might not born bad, but if they are under drug and alcohol influence, they can do scary things like these: http://www.angelfire.com/rebellion2/alcoholism/traits.html favorite food: pho, mongolian beef favorite shows: anime, asian drama/movies, american films (comedy, sci-fi, romance, action) favorite music: trance and house favorite books: i don't read books, i just read tech and stock news, tech reviews and benchmarks on websites. hk movies i like: 2 (the asian version of the fast and the furious) 2011 (romance & comedy)  (romance & comedy)  (side story of young and dangerous series) korean drama i like: full house, emperor of the sea, autumn tale, winter sonata, delightful girl choon-hyang american films i like: aliens, batman, contact, die hard, gattaca, serenity, silent hill, the bourne, the fast and the furious, the fifth element, the girl next door  i like this song: http://www.youtube.com/watch/?v=ujujyxfegrm 1. cellphone 2. wallet 3. car 4. computer 5. family 6. friends making and saving money and plan for the future, so i can provide a happy and worry-free life for my family. home watching movies, sleeping or working, sometimes at 24hourfitness or with friends. i don't like weekends and holidays, because the stock market is closed, i wish it's a 24/7/365 thing ^_^; i'm too caring and trusting. 1. you think i'm cute 2. you are normal and sane, this means no drugs (weed is not okay), no alcoholic. if you used to do it when you were in high school because of friends influence but no longer do it now, then that's okay. everyone make mistakes, what's important is learn from the past and move toward the future. 3. you are not a player/cheater, meaning you don't sleep with random people when you are in a commited relationship. 4. you are healthy, this means no std, no serious diseases or health issues. 5. you think you would be a good wife and good mom in the future. 6. you are not a regular visitor at the casinos, it's okay to hang out with friends and play some mah jong or holdem, but if you are a heavy gambler that regularly visit casinos, you can possibly lose your house, your car, and milk money for your kids when you have kids ^_^; 7. you are not a commitment-phobe, you must be open to marriage and kids after few years of being in a relationship. this is very important for me as a traditional old-fashioned chinese, i want to see my kids grow up, watch them get married and live to see my grand kids before i die.  bonus pts: if you can speak chinese. if you can cook, eating restaurant all the time is not healthy. if you are emotionally sensitive, sensitive people connect better, people who aren't might not understand what emotional fulfillment mean, you damn right i'm talking about you sagittarius and year of rat =) careless/carefree? don't do that on everything, be selective. i hear things like \"don't take yourself or life too seriously\", how can you be responsible and dependable if you don't take life seriously?\n",
      "i spent my early youth in the military. i studied engineering for my masters degree and now work on solving some of the most interesting problems humanity faces. i howl better than any wolf you have ever met. i have actually wrestled with a bear. i climb better than most monkeys. i have a stronger brain than i do body. my life is comprised of training my mind and by body to become a unified instrument of... actually. i don't know why i am training so hard. i guess i like hard work. i can cook, but not meat. typing a ridiculous essay, and wondering why i hate going to bars so much. all my buddies can pick up women when they are inebriated, but i have no idea how to start up a conversation at a bar. nor how to speak to some kid who thinks that going to said bar to pay 6 dollars per beer is the pinnacle of excitement. hang-gliding base-jumping rock climbing walking a tight-rope cogitation and mastication falling off horses and landing on my feet an aimless but somehow endearing style of writing sliding motorized vehicles under cooking vegatables so they are still crunchy my intense penetrating stare that bares your soul and ... this is such crap. i have no idea what people notice about me first. it used to be a big gun (marines). now i don't carry a gun (not in marines). i am pretty sure that when i did that was the thing they saw first and the third and the last. when someone carries a gun it tends to draw your attention. i actually don't much care for guns. i'd be down to get rid of most of them, but governments are run by men and men have the tendency to become tyrants (we should probably let women run everything) when they are not afraid of their people, so i guess we can't get rid of all the guns but i prefer not to be around them when i have the option and this, everyone, is a run on sentence characterized by a lack of proper punctuation. i hope my style comes off as kerouac-esque not just insane. i enjoy sci-fi more than i care to admit. i spend quite a bit of time translating classic works in languages that i am studying. i don't watch much tv, but i do download a few shows at the end of their seasons (dexter, true blood, the closer, l&o). xkcd.com rocks and fits my sense of humor as well as theoatmeal.com npr a goal ambition touch hope exercise a goal the answer is e - all of the above. how to destroy the weakness in my soul. as most men i spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about how pleasant women are to look at (not a creepy troll, merely honest) ah oh. i just creeped myself out. i remember a saying \"the louder a man says that he is not a thief, the harder i hold onto my wallet.\" how does one protest the fact they enjoy the sight of women and that they are not lewd, or inappropriate, or creepy about it without making onesself appear as more of a creep or troll or whatever the vernacular is? not drinking heavily. not watching football. not sitting on my butt wasting my life (although the occasional vegetative recuperative period is vital) i lied about one thing on my profile. i am freely willing to admit what it is if you ask me about it (what an awesome attempt to be an international man-of-mystery). why did i do this? probably because this is all an attempt for me to avoid working for a while. i think the more anyone tries to filter and distill down their essence online the more craptastic and unrealistic it becomes. hopefully what you get from the typed drivel is that i am fun, i love working out, i am moderately intelligent, and that i am willing to admit to a certain amount of oscar meyer... i mean bologna. i like women that can kick my ass. you don't have to be able to kick my ass, but it is cool if you can. i care not whether said ass kicking is intellectual or physical, but i prefer it to be thorough. occasionally do i invert word order to make myself sound as wise as yoda. \"strong he is in the ways of the force.\" you can kick my ass. you are as proud of your brain as you are the fact that you take care of yourself. you infrequently wear makeup or silly high heels you do yoga. i need to stretch and i am more willing to do so if you are doing it with me (i will admit i like the spandex but i really need to stretch).\n",
      "i'm a senior in berkeley engineering, and bay area native (born and raised). i love exploring and doing wacky things (like pillow fights or giant nerf gun battles) but i take my school work and research very seriously. one of my favorite things to do is adventure around the campus at night and try to find all the little nooks and crannies that most people ignore, and then look at the stars and try to figure out which ones are planets, and, if its a clear night, try to spot a satellite as it crosses the sky. my schoolwork and shenanigans combined make me a very busy person, but i always find time for my friends and the people i care about.  i often find myself trapped in thought, thinking about some minute detail about how the world works, and then getting lost in that thought. i often wish i had someone to share that with. currently my plans are to finish undergraduate education at berkeley and then go to graduate school for a phd. from there, i plan to work in high-tech industry for a while, and then get a mba and go into management of a tech company. hugging. and making people feel better about themselves. people love to talk to me about their problems because i'm really good at listening and really good at hugging. i'm rather tall. i'm always in a good mood. i have a natural gift to find the best out of the situation and hold on to that happy thought, even if the situation is terrible. i don't have as much time to read as i would like, but i love dis-topian novels, because they always get me thinking about how a society could become like that, and how we can prevent that outcome. my favorite book is probably \"brave new world\" mostly because in many ways the society is a utopia, but is eerily disturbing due to the lack of human ambition and progress. i sometimes wonder how close to that reality we are.  when i was a little kid i loved star trek, but now i prefer shows like how i met your mother or big bang theory (i'm trying to get into dr. who). in general, i try to avoid watching too much tv. i would much rather be doing something active like swimming or hiking or going out somewhere with friends.  when it comes to food, i am a total snob for italian food, but much less picky when it comes to mexican, american, or pretty much any other cuisine. internet good food family and friends naptime books or magazines something to do i think a lot about my future, where i would want to live (suburbia or a city), how many kids i would want, how my daily routine will change from now to then.  i also think a lot about the future in general; what things will be like 10 or 20 years from now, and how things are made, where materials come from, and admiring the wonderful complexity of the world that allows for everything we take for granted, from the food we eat to the tools we work with. then i get lost in my own thoughts and try to figure out how i came to thinking about what i was thinking about. out on an adventure! i can see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch! if you are looking for someone to go on an adventure with!  or if you think about things the same way i do, or just have something interesting to say. i love learning.  i'd like a chance to get to know you before doing anything or going on a date. coffee is a good option for first time we meet.\n",

      "i've decided to use this space to share a paragraph that i wrote to someone explaining the type of relationship that i'm interested in and am holding out for.... here goes:  \"what i do know is that i'm completely clear that my mate is committed to growth, to truly shift unhealthy behaviors - from less effective ways of relating to thriving ways of relating, and that he will compassionately challenge me to do the same. our relationship... it's juicy, it's gorgeous, it's a stretch, it's hard, it's messy, it's sublime, it's passionate, it's a pain in the ass, it's exquisitely intimate, it's real, it's grounded, it's frustrating at times, it's freedom, it's amazing, and it's an unfolding outrageous adventure...  it's a meeting of two multi-dimensional humans who are holding hands and are consciously relating while journeying together in the utter mystery of life, spinning on this orb in the middle of space, somewhat clueless about why we're here but who nonetheless choose to make a partnership that is rich and meaningful and conscious yet one that is steeped in the unfolding mystery because what other choice is there, really?...\"  i'm committed to living as authentic a life as i dare to live. and, this includes working towards being a healthy communicator. what does healthy communication within a partnership mean to me? it means that each of us chooses to take risks to speak about a need, a boundary, or an upset in order to strengthen intimacy vs. create distance; it's about being direct vs. passive or passive aggressive; it's about taking responsibility for one's feelings vs. blaming the other... and it's about being respectful and kind. that said, i'm a work in progress.  i long to co-create a family with my partner, whether it's just the two of us, a miracle long-shot conception, an adoption, or supporting you in raising your children. i'm committed to being of service in as many ways as possible and to having a fabulous time in the process! for fun, i love to dance, kayak, snorkel, walk in nature, play music with friends, go to see live music, write poetry and travel logs, share dinner and time with friends, and go on spontaneous overnights/significant adventures. witty rapport, a handful of dialects, d a n c e, showing up fully and being present. the sparkle in my eyes, the smile on my face, and the sincere interest that i have about life and the people/animals/plants in it. i love the author susan vreeland - historical fictions about art, pioneering women, and nature. my movie interests range from thought-provoking alternative films shown at the rafael (buck), to nature documentaries (winged migration), to smart guys flicks (spy games/italian job). i love live music - yoshi's for jazz, hardly strictly bluegrass, stern grove, or a jam session... i also sing and am somewhat capable of playing basic guitar. i love indian food, some italian, vietnamese french fusion and the opportunity to drink some fine red wine in a beautiful setting. the sun and the elements of nature; music; organic chocolate; dance; meaningful relationships with family, friends, and hopefully with a partner someday soon; poetry. ways to support myself and others to embrace and to express our true nature, our amazing potential, and our endless creativity. and, i can't leave out that i do think a lot about the utter mystery of this existence and that i'm so thankful that there's so much that i have yet to know and to understand. there is no typical friday night. i'm as playful as i am intense. you're available to explore and are wanting to be in a long-term monogamous relationship.\n",

(copious amounts of tea required.) independent, but fiercely compassionate. incredibly wise, but young at heart. i'm an outgoing, quick-witted introvert; while i'm living inside my head, i can be seen commiserating with elderly women on crowded buses or befriending the neighborhood hairdresser.  i am creative, philosophical, and passionate. i've been diving in the great barrier reef, ridden a motorcycle on the italian coast, mosh-pitted in venice during carnivale, floated in the dead sea, repelled down a 90 foot mountain, been to coffeeshops in amsterdam, and reconstructed ancient etruscan urns. i try to do and see as much as possible while still being a productive member of society.  while i'm not suffering from a case of wanderlust, i create architectural models, work at my school's media center, hang out with friends, and watch terrible action movies on netflix. being there for people when they need me, being entirely non-judgemental, enjoying every moment, remaining optimistic, dry sarcasm, all-nighters, being upfront and honest, giving hand massages, dancing on tabletops (sometimes in the library), cuddling, kissing, loyalty, making up nicknames that stick, conversations with strangers, working far too hard on my art, pretending to be working in the first place while actually just talking with friends. according to the man who hemmed my pants yesterday, i look like i'm 16, am the cutest thing he's ever seen, and should do my best to \"keep those little hips.\" let's pretend he wasn't being a creeper and was just being friendly.  also, i'm apparently really chill/non-awkward when meeting new people. books: anything oscar wilde, orson scott card, or sylvia plath. when i'm too lazy to search for a good read, i resort to trash fiction.  movies: early 90s movies that are completely random and cheesy, like 10 things i hate about you. if you haven't seen it, that will soon change.  music: i listen to a lot of indie (silversun pickups, the bravery, postal service, the shins, ratatat), pop (lady gaga, justin timberlake, jason mraz) , and horrible mainstream rap music (eminem, etc.). the last sort makes me feel like i am all-powerful.  food: i try to go out for indian food at least once a week and then live off the leftovers in the days following. i like spicy foods in general. i also have a passion for tea (chai specifically), which i definitely think counts as a food. 1) a camera 2) chapstick 3) chai tea lattes 4) intelligent conversations 5) silliness 6) passion how i wish to someday capture the world with a camera so i can remember things and people to be just as beautiful as they are. future adventures. theoretical possibilities as opposed to actualities. a book i've read or a book i wish to read. something someone said five minutes ago but warranted further reflection. do i feel like wearing a skirt or boys jeans today? industrialism-- grain elevators specifically-- and modernism (can they be hybridized to be sustainable?). details. lines, shapes, textures, forms. either hanging out at a coffee shop, eating pizza and watching a movie with friends, or going out to find some sort of party. my brother and i steal each other's clothes. -you want to fly a kite in golden gate park -you want to eat indian pizza and drink chai tea at zantes -you want to go hiking outside the city or -you want to teach me something new\n",

      "i tend to believe in all things in moderation, and that can include moderation itself. i also really appreciate the phrase \"go big or go home\" when appropriately used. for the most part i'm pretty easy going. i've recently been accused of being too nice. (what kind of accusation is that, anyway?)  ocean or mountains? can't choose. i love them both. i generally like most outdoor activities.  i enjoy making things with my hands, and i value craftsmanship in the world around me. i tend to write things out when typing texts and emails that other people abbreviate.  i like to cook when time allows. lately i've been pretty into my slow-cooker; i often make what i call \"kitchen sink soup\" (as in, everything but the _ ) using whatever i have on hand that is soup-worthy. believe it or not, it's often quite good.  i'm not very good at following politics or talking about politics. i'm crazy about puppies. good puns make me laugh. i have fantastic friends. i'm pretty good at whistling. i like my hair and i've never colored / dyed it before, but ask me a funny story about it from my college years if we get to know each other. learning to be a landscape architect and playing ultimate frisbee as often as i can. making popcorn making pots out of clay on a wheel admiring the ocean eating ice cream remembering things, sometimes. depends what it is, i suppose. rescuing spiders from the great indoors and releasing them into the great outdoors. bringing a flask of bourbon looking out for my friends ask me what kind of tree that is i've heard that i have a great laugh. i tend to wear red things. i'm kinda tall. recently i've been reading short stories. i think it's because i've been going in and out of reading phases, so i often put a book down and don't pick it back up for a while. also, as a student i feel guilty reading non-school things when there's always a ton of \"required\" reading i should be doing...  movies: mostly anything, except for scary stuff. i tell myself it's not real but it still gets into my head... i'm a real sucker for pixar stuff, also wallace & gromit, and other light-hearted, simple fare. i don't have a tv, but i sometimes indulge in some shows via the interwebs. (mini vacation for a frazzled brain).  food: fresh figs. brussels sprouts (yes, you read that right. and if you don't like 'em, you might not have had them made the right way...). really good coffee (emphasis on the really and the good). cheese (sheep's milk cheese is probably my favorite right now). soups 'n stews. polenta. all kinds of squash, summer and winter. all kinds of whiskey but especially bourbon. favorite popcorn topping: olive oil + lemon juice + salt + cumin + nutritional yeast. i make my own yogurt sometimes, and i've been known to make kombucha and sauerkraut as well. (yup, cultured foods. deal with it.)  music... is always a tough one because i don't feel like i know the right terminology to describe what i like. probably mostly indie stuff, often of the folk-influenced variety but sometimes more of the pop genre or other things. favorite of my pandora stations right now = arcade fire. take some classics like johnny cash or the pixies, mix in some postal service and mgmt, a few spoonfuls of bon iver and iron & wine, a splash of kings of leon and beirut, and sprinkle in the tallest man on earth and kid icarus. exploring (places to explore, and ways to get around) good food, beverages family, friends, nice strangers pen + paper / sketchbook people, places, how things work spaces, forms, textures, plants, landscapes, graphics how much i like dogs, and when can i get one? the human experience is pretty interesting -- why do we do what we do? whatever is coming up / on the horizon one day having chickens in my backyard. in general, eating, drinking, socializing and/or adventures. but perhaps instead just relaxing after a busy week. and maybe just maybe doing a bit of schoolwork if necessary. there's no such thing as a typical friday. yes, i'm probably a lot like every other female on okcupid. you're friendly and kind and you're kinda goofy when not being serious. you're down with dive bars but think fancy affairs can be fun, too. you do things and go places. you're active and you even like some vegetables. maybe you like cooking with or for people sometimes. maybe you like going on adventures.\n",

am i past my prime tattoo years? does anyone really check the box looking for just \"sex\"?! max, my future dog. trying to increase my alcohol tolerance. staying up past midnight. surreptitiously perusing okc profiles. i want to be first thing you think of when you wake up, whispering into your mind when you're falling asleep, dripping into your soul like molasses on a warm day, feeling your heartbeat against my skin while listening to you sleep, holding your hand when no one is looking, and making you smile from the inside when you least expect it. you want to hang out on a vertical basis and do not otherwise wear a ring on the fourth finger of your left hand or have a \"roommate\" that you share a studio apartment with one futon. you need to make your ex-girlfriend jealous. you need a back up date to your co-worker's sister's daughter's wedding, quinceanera, baptism, red-egg party, bris, 25th wedding anniversary or other event involving food, dancing, and wearing a dress (that would be me, not you). you own a suit and you are good at holding purses while i attend such events. you need a designated driver (and have a car, otherwise, that would be pointless). you need help finishing that last pint of ice cream (but if it's mint chocolate chip, don't bother) or would like to enjoy a polish dog but lack the privilege of a costco membership.\n",
      "witty, educated, well-traveled guy who's tough to get to know but worth the extra effort. i'll be adding to this as i go, i suppose, since i'm usually updating a resume rather than a personal profile. i just turned 50 and i'm already used to it. it's funny how old i used to think 50 was. i still don't know what i wanna be when i grow up. i do know i want to get back into travel. i've been lucky enough to visit 26 countries and 36 states. time to renew that passport i guess. solving problems and thinking out of the box. on the physical side it's probably my eyes. on the social side it's my sense of humor and...ummm, you'll see. i read mostly non-fiction these days, but i like adventure novels too. i'm a big movie buff...all kinds. some of my favs are 'saving private ryan', 'pulp fiction' and 'blazing saddles'. i enjoy sports on tv, talk radio and singer/songwriter stuff. i love insanely spicy food. air verbs car keys coffee google the ability to count to 6. anagrams. winding down from the week gone by. i joined this website. you can spell.\n",

(i do consider taking long walks, sipping tea or staring out the train window to be excellent uses of time). listening, genuinely. crafting something tasty from whatever tidbits are in the corners of your fridge. keeping in touch. being aware of others' needs, and addressing them. hatching mad plans and carrying them out. being a cheerleader for equally passionate people. it feels silly to pick some physical feature - there are pics to answer that question for you, dear viewer. but i'll take a stab; quick smile, general lack of pretense, boyish energy. and the everpresent hat (i shave my head since my hairline started receding - there ya go - full disclosure is a value!). i don't think a laundry list here is especially helpful. but i'll play along and pick a few.  pilgrim at tinker creek by annie dillard, and desert solitaire by edward abbey. funny that i never finished either, but i still pick them up to random pages and find something inspiring.  i have a thing for repo man - found it deeply spiritual. and stay was the most moving film i've seen in recent years.  music...it's my field, i can't really pick favorites. i have eclectic and passionate tastes in just about any genre. but still am a sucker for a sappy '50's tune.  foodwise...again, hard to pick favorites, seems unfair. but i'm a sort of vegetarian, the pesco-ovu-lacto type, which skews things. i adore sushi, and cheese especially. not at the same meal though. heavens... a blank page. an instrument. a flame, a knife, a pot. the regular, though not constant, company of others, strange or familiar. some nice aged gouda, or gruyere, humboldt fog, maybe piave...drool... well...i spend a lot of time thinking, period. i take things to heart - maybe too much so - and reflect frequently.  one of my favorite things that anyone has said about me was a friend who, when someone asked if i meditated, replied that i meditate as i walk.  (the second favorite thing that a friend said is that i am exactly who i seem to be. that was nice.) playing a show at a nameless cafe, bar, gallery or squat, deep in the oblivion of the road. if there's no show, i'll be in a kitchen, preferably with six or eight acquaintances hanging out, opening bottles of wine and complimenting the smells. i'm happy to be upfront about anything...just ask. at this point in my life, i feel like i have nothing to lose, and thus tend to overshare without regard for personal embarrassment. i don't necessarily demand the same level of frankness from others, though honesty is important. i really hate mind games.  otherwise, it's not especially private that i'm not interested in the typical work-hard-play-hard-long-walks-on-the-beach-on-two-weeks-vacation kind of thing that may be hinted at in other profiles here. my life is a wee bit unusual. i'm passionate, if not simply obsessed, with art, music, food and people, and that's what i build my existence around. you can deal with the fact that i don't live in your city. at least ...not yet.  you have a constant need to create. you take care of yourself. you are you.  or if you find all of this to be hilariously pretentious claptrap, yet still read the whole thing and wouldn't mind a chat with a fella who will be interested in what you say and has a good chance of making you laugh.\n",
      "where to start without sounding like a cv.  i traveled considerably over the past ten years. after living and working in saigon (ho chi minh city), seoul, paris and so paulo, i grew homesick and decided to return to california. there is something special about being in between the pacific and the sierras that is comforting and makes me feel grounded.  my dad is american and my mother is french/spanish. i learned french before english and though now my english is better than my french, i still have a very slight accent that i have never managed to shake.  in between my last two projects, i walked across the north of spain on the camio de santiago and the john muir trail. i am not sure what my next adventure will be but i would like to start bike touring and get another opportunity to spend some time in the mountains.  my big dream is sailing to hawaii, up to alaska and back down to san francisco. i'd love to come back in through the gate after a long journey. there are few things that i enjoy more than the feeling of starting a new project, business, adventure. i love start-ups, one off projects and events.  right now i am working with a small start-up that makes the world's most amazing bicycle lights. i do sales, marketing and business operations. i feel incredibly lucky to be working with people and a product that i love. finally, i am working with hardware instead of software and love being able to see a finished product in my hands.  being in a startup means that if the work needs to be done, i do it. if that means an 80 hour week, ok. i like the intensity of working one on one with the founder and engineer. there are few things more satisfying than being able to turn on a dime and have no petty politics or bureaucracy to deal with.  outside of work i like to do active or/and outdoors activities.  keeping fit is important to me. i go to the gym on a regular basis, go bouldering and ride my bike everywhere i go. i like feeling like i can take on any adventure or activity that comes my way.  recently, i became involved with a crazy bunch of cats that have a free trimaran and spend time fixing the boat and hoping to get a chance to spend some more time on the bay sailing. cooking, communicating with people who do not speak a common language, walking and sailing. i am not sure, but i always feel that they notice my accent. books: infinite jest, the stranger, lord jim, the wind-up bird chronicle, dance dance dance, the adventures of kavalier and clay, the yiddish policeman's union, dona flor and her two husbands, anathem, do androids dream of electric sheep, the list could go on forever, i love reading.  movies: tampopo, blade runner, amelie, the good the bad and the ugly, darjeeling limited, once upon a time in the west, big budget nature documentaries.  food: french, new american, japanese, vietnamese, chinese, recently ethiopian and much much more.  tv show: not a fan in general. i'm one of those people that grew up with no tv and never got in the habit. that being said if i am left alone infront of a tv i will flip channels for hours, mouth agape at the total stupidity of it all. 1)good food 2)good friends 3)books 4)a laptop 5)pen 6)paper life, the universe and everything... recently, i have been focused on work, so i am thinking about how to promote cycling and how to keep cyclists safe at night. meeting up with friends for drinks or going to sleep so i can wake up early for a saturday adventure. i am on an online dating site. if you want to go bike riding if you take the scenic long route if you want to paddle around the marina on hot tub covers if you want to go sailing if you are always reading something\n",

      "i'm out-going, fun, happy and energetic. i like to make people laugh - hey, i even do improv comedy. i do international consulting in the video games industry which has allowed me to do some great adventuring around the world. sometimes i end-up at a casino where i get to do my other hobby - play craps - i do what people consider \"urban legend\" - i'm a \"dice controller\"  ask me what that's all about - i lead an interesting life ;) i'm an entrepreneur and an international consultant in the video games industry. the consultant work i do lets me travel to some exciting places in the world like - abu dhabi, dubai, buenos aires, singapore, hong kong, shanghai, tokyo, and macau.  i love traveling to new places and adventuring - i'm used to traveling alone, but i make friends easily along the way. now, i have friends all over the world.  when i'm not traveling, i'm performing improv comedy - sporadically ;)  sometimes i hit hit vegas or macau and come home with \"some of their money\". my username here is actually my nickname in the casinos - because when i win, i tend to say, \"it's not nacho money anymore!\"  i used to do film documentaries on steam locomotives - on my last trip, i was filming from a helicopter chasing a train going 80 mph, sideways, with the doors removed - wild ride, man! making people smile and laugh. i'm also good at getting people to trust me with some of their most private feelings and thoughts. people feel at ease when talking with me mainly because i can share a lot of my deeper thoughts and feelings as well.  i'm a good way to \"escape\" - at least that's what i've been told... i'm happy, fun and outgoing. i live for the moment - in the world of \"now\". because of my out-look on life, people think i'm younger than i really am. i'm a batman freak - so all of those movies :) i like reality tv shows, but got burnt out - however, i'm loving shows like \"the walking dead\" i like books about how to live life today like: \"courage:the joy of living dangerously\", \"blink\" malcolm gladwell, \"4 hour work week\" i like all kinds of music - heavy on the alternative side i love my seafood - especially crawfish! mmmm laughter fun adventure a little danger a little mystery a good pizza just having fun and keeping \"expectation\" outta my life as much as possible. by doing that, i find i'm really enjoying the \"journey\" instead of worrying or having anxiety about it. always doing something different - i don't plan my friday's - they just happen. i was probably more afraid of living life 2 years ago than i was willing to admit. i was the typical a-type, goal oriented personality - sure i was successful, but was i happy?  i found happiness when i changed - let go of all of that \"shit\" and started living for today - in the moment. now life is fun, exciting - and a little mysterious/dangerous at times ;) you wanna have fun you like to explore you wanna do things without a lot of planning - just \"go with it\" - make a temporary \"escape\" from who you are now  you wanna see movies at the alamodrafthouse during the afternoon where you can just chill ;)\n",

      "about me:  i've lived in san francisco for 5 years. prior to that, i was in pittsburgh for school at carnegie mellon. i grew up just outside washington dc, in montgomery county maryland, and i was born in france. i travel frequently to new york and las vegas to see family, friends, and deadmau5. that said, i'm never away from home for too long because i love sf.  ohh and i party a lot -- 4 to 5 music festivals a year and at the club once a week...maybe twice.  http://soundcloud.com/mistersupaa-style/  about her:  she has strong personality and character, like someone from a sitcom. she is witty, and talks back - lays the smack down when necessary. she can be just a little crazy at times, but not insane. she is adventurous...willing to try new things for a taste of adrenaline. she enjoys shopping and taking care of herself, so she dresses and smells better than i do. she goes out and knows how to party. places like concerts, football games, car shows, race tracks, music festivals, and dance clubs don't scare her. she likes spontaneous travel, even if its just for a weekend in tahoe or an entire week in europe. she eats meat (e.g. beef, chicken, fish). she is able to hang with the boys and is part of the crew, not part of the cargo. she can be goofy or silly, because she who laughs last thinks slowest. she welcomes animals...emphasis on the \"s\", because only one gets lonely. she doesn't work for life, but her life is her work. improving it. being funny cooking taking photos making music with ableton live listening to you telling bad jokes investing i'm loud and i'll say anything that comes to mind before thinking twice...foolishly at times. -books are old, i like magazines and blogs...and pictures  -funny movies, for example: something about mary & money talks  -shows are usually fun places to get drunk  -electronic dance music, hip-hop, rap, pop. in that order.  -good food is everywhere in san francisco, just look -loyal friends -fine food -dance music -fast cars -great gadgets -memorable vacations what i'm going to eat next partying...or passed out by 9pm what u wanna know? you can hang\n",
      "i love to explore the city when i'm not busy studying and buried in the books. i'm kind of a nerd, but i enjoy relaxing and having a good time too. i've lived in san francisco for five years, and one of my favortite things to do is to explore new spots and art exhibits and eateries in the bay. i like to paint, read, frolic, cook, bake, spend time with the fam when possible, and skype good friends i who i haven't seen in months. i'm a third year graduate student studying clinical psychology. i just obtained my master's degree and am working in substance abuse treatment as i accrue hours towards my doctorate degree. i love reading about new theories and research in psychology and learning about different perspectives in the field. cooking and eating and parking. i'm friendly and enjoy random conversation. drowning in psychology reading makes it hard to fit in leisurely books, but i'm a fan of barack obama, t. ogden, anything by freud, anything by chelsea handler, hamlet will always remain dear to my heart.  movies are a must, some faves are goodfellas, american beauty, american history x, blow, random other ones.  music- a long list but some core ones are tool, a perfect circle, anything by maynard actually..portishead, radiohead, the mars volta, fiona apple, thrice, stp, anything 90's grunge, chili peppers, anything with jack white, the pumpkins, recent obsession with lady gaga, i will always have an undying love for dave gahan, brandon boyd, and gavin rossdale..  food- many things..italian, mexican, indian and persian food will always be at the top of the list, but i am open for new and different kinds. meat is negotiable. i have a love-hate relationship with meat. chicken and i get along a bit better. i suppose i'd say i'm a selective carnivore. family, friends, chapstick, water with lemon, music, paint finding time to go to the gym, where i parked my car on the block, orchestrating music festivals/shows to attend either on a date with jack daniels and the friends, or at home cooking, painting, and watching cheezy tv with the roomies. in the eighth grade, i got fired from a babysitting job for stealing a box of girl scout cookies. if you have a good joke\n",
      "my friends describe me as warm, witty, thoughtful and dependable. i am level-headed but have a sassy side and a dry sense of humor.  i've lived in the us for ~17 years and have adopted the best of the east and the west. i enjoy spending time with friends and family over a glass of wine, a meal, or a movie but also enjoy \"me\" or \"alone\" time. i also enjoy hiking, traveling (recent travels include sicily and kenya and tanzania), reading fiction, watching movies and playing with my brother's dog.  i value my friends and family, a life of learning, warmth, sincerity, and honesty. i crunch numbers and play with spreadsheets by day and go to the gym, sculpt, and read by night. analyzing things/issues, learning from past experiences, listening. my warm demeanor. don't watch tv, so shows are out. music - i enjoy a wide spectrum ranging from bach to lady gaga. books - love reading in bed at night...recent reads include empire falls and bossypants. movies - hmm, no favorites come to mind. food - love stir-fry's, thai, a good healthy salad, and dark chocolate. i don't think of friends and family as \"things\", so here goes: sunshine books music car (i would feel really stranded!) phone (i like to stay in touch with people!) coffee the future but am getting much better at living in the present! hanging out with friends or family. this one will have to wait! you are warm and thoughtful  you make me laugh in good times and are strongly supportive through rough patches. you are a good conversationalist and a good listener. you are self-aware, self-assured, and comfortable in your own skin. you are financially responsible but don't live to work  you make your relationship/significant other a priority. you are mature, kind, compassionate and have a high level of integrity. you acknowledge your mistakes and learn from them. you communicate  the good and the bad but always gently. you realize that being in a relationship requires effort, vulnerability, and give and take.  you are patient and willing to invest the time in getting to know me.\n",
      "i am very much myself-i don't know how to be anything else. i love conversation and i hate small talk. i am endlessly curious about other humans. i am equal parts compassion and impatience, but at least i'm aware of it. the only time i follow rules is when i'm playing a board game.  i have a long-term lover that i expect to live with until i die. i don't need any more romantic soul mates, but i would like new friends.  the stuff in brackets below is what i wrote when i first set up my profile. i like it.   blah blah stuff blah ferret blah blah troublemaker blah for the love of god is it long enough yet blah blah blah.  no, clearly not long enough.  how about now?  nope, not yet. my roommate blond_alchemist says \"we are hot and blonde\". i say she's drunk, but not wrong.  i am playful, blunt, and a troublemaker. i am lucky to have a job that is also a personal mission. i'm a sustainable building and design consultant, working with various organizations and large utilities to transform our infrastructure before it falls in on our collective heads. i'm stubbornly optimistic about my work, because otherwise i wouldn't get out of bed in the morning.  if i woke up tomorrow and the environmental crisis was solved, i would open my own artisan bakery in oakland. making pastry, dancing, appreciating absurdity, seeing the big picture  also theoretical math, energy analysis and engineering, program management, and rafting whitewater-i have broad interests :)  oh, i'm a champion napper. i love to nap. i love it even more when i have a partner. this is a silly question-how should i know?  edit: i've been getting lots of email comments about my hair lately, so i guess that's something. books i love that will tell you something about me: the dispossessed (ursula leguin), the will to change (bell hooks), transmetropolitan (and anything by warren ellis), red mars (kim stanley robinson), lies my teacher told me, diamond age (neil stephenson), what does it mean to be well educated? (alfie kohn), the noonday demon...  i like many movies, from the die hard series to stranger than fiction. i have a thing for movies from my 80s childhood, things like romancing the stone and willow. i don't do horror, period. i have an active imagination and strong visualization abilities, which do not go well with the creepy.  i don't even begin to know how to describe my taste in music. i like many things. my most recent acquisition was an album of leonard cohen songs recorded by jennifer warnes.  fresh produce, creative cuisine, all types of international food...salads with nuts, fruit and cheese may be the most perfect food on earth, but i also love bbq ribs. i have been various types of vegetarian in my life, my current food habits are too complicated to explain here. i love to make desserts of all kinds, and eat them. chocolate, moving water, dancing, sleep, sunlight, human touch sustainability, organizational honesty and transparency, the bizarre workings of my own mind. also pie, cake, crepes, croissants, and cream puffs.  i spend a lot of time trying not to think about impending climate doom, the toxic fumes coming off of my non-stick pans, or the pthalates leaching into my lemonade from that plastic cup. out at art murmur, inventing a new game, or curled up at home doing nothing and loving it. i dunno. if you've got a burning question just ask me. it strikes your fancy to do so. i like getting mail!  having said that, some fine print:  i have a long-term partner and i'm not looking for casual sex. i'm mostly here for the entertainment value, and maybe to meet new friends.  writing skills are important to me-if you send me an email in chatspeak i'm not likely to respond.  carry on then!\n",

      "i try to be a regular guy. i've got my good points and my foibles.  i've traveled a bit, so i can tell you some stories about tokyo, montreal, and lots of other places. i'm almost always up for a well-planned trip, and when the occasion is right doing something spontaneous.  i'm pretty big into photography. you can check out some of my stuff at http://www.flickr.com/photos/geuis and http://500px.com/geuis. if you have tattoos, i'd be particularly interested in talking to you about a shoot i've been planning for a while.  i'm pretty interested in building things by hand from scratch. i have a spare room that i keep having different ideas of what to do with. at one point was thinking about an inside garden, but i have been getting more studio lighting equipment so i think it will become a photography studio now.  also really interested in metalworking and have built my own furnace before. i think it would be pretty cool to spend some time in the woods scavenging metal trash and shaping it into usable tools to survive in the wilderness.  my day job is in tech as a programmer, engineer type.  i have this on-going project of learning how to bake bread well. i freely admit i'm not the most creative cook in the world. that being said, i keep working on different kinds of bread and am finally getting decent at it. at the time of writing this, i just made 2 loaves infused with fresh garlic and maple syrup, and it came out just right. i'm rather proud of my bread.  other than that, i can tell you that i'm totally into science and other things smart people enjoy. talk to me about astronomy or telescopes and you won't get me to shut up. zombies rock. other horror movies ain't my cup of tea. sci-fi is one of my favorite genres. redheads hold a special place in my heart.  i'm definitely a family oriented fellow. kids are pretty awesome (except when they aren't) and would eventually like to head down that path with the right person. what am i doing? hmm. getting by day to day. playing poker on occasion with my buddies. working and trying to get a company off the ground on the side. sampling the occasional glass of scotch and/or whisky in some particular order. taking care of the little pup i got a few months ago. i'm good at what i do for a living. i take decent photos. somehow i make the right kind of people laugh. most recently, a couple of different people have said they like my laugh. that's a nice compliment, though an uncommon one.  i usually have a camera with me. got a new corgi puppy too, so she's with me a lot of the time now.  i have a pretty deep bassy voice, so i have gotten the \"are you on radio?\" question a lot over the years. the following are a handful of books i've read that i remember best. i have read a lot more, so it might be on that list.  books: anathem the years of rice and salt lillith's brood (creepiest novel i've ever read) machine of death women (bukowski) neuromancer the singularity is near marrow hyperion/fall of hyperion pattern recognition hundreds of others...  holy crap, i didn't add a tv shows section. i don't have cable but watch my favorites online, as all normal people do now:  breaking bad downton abbey eureka futurama american dad south park mythbusters warehouse 13 falling skies (guilty pleasure) walking dead (zombies!) awake (good show, off the air far too soon) others...  my list of music is totally random so don't make any conclusions from this list. i have an affinity for irish music if its around or live jazz if i hear it walking down the street. just ask if i like a song and i can tell you.  music: coldplay kings of leon adele april smith the killers lily allen rage against the machine rebelution rush sean criss sevara nazarkhan shiny toy guns system of a down thievery corporation yeah yeah yeahs john & sasha digweed christopher lawrence  movies: a ton of 'em. all-time favorite movie is gattaca. one of the best movies, cinematically at least, is children of men. paddy (whiskey. sadly, being phased out) my camera my corgi family 2 books on how to rebuild civilization coffee should i drop everything and go back to school for astronomy. there's not a lot of demand for astronomers, but discovering things about the universe is pretty damn cool.  i also think, \"what is the puppy chewing on now?\" a lot. its a new thing. taking some photos, out with friends, hitting a dive bar, watching some movies at home, etc. my ears are ticklish. also, i just ran into a question about whether i would kill a spider or take it outside, so i'm updating this here.  i *hate* spiders. i keep a plumbers blowtorch in my kitchen. i use it specifically to torch the hideous little bastards if they are anywhere in my house. if you know the saying, \"kill it with fire\", well... i do. if anything i wrote sounds interesting. i won't bite.\n",

      "i'm an eager, smart, passionate, hilarious person. i have great friends, a fun dog, an exciting career, and a wonderful family. i'd love to find a partner, though i don't need someone to \"complete\" me. i'm optimistic and empathetic, so connect easily with people.  now for my dating theory lecture (after all, i am a professor): i don't think there's just one perfect person out there for anyone (deep, wonderful relationships involve flexibility!). i've noticed that people tend to treat online dating like online shopping rather than one way to possibly develop a deep connection with a person. i'm not an advocate of \"settling\" for something less than a great relationship. but this grass-is-always-greener trend seems likely to leave a lot of people on an endless search.  so... if this jives with your reasons for being on here, and you think we might get along, send me a message. please no long-distance penpal crap. i've got enough friends spread out across the world that i'm trying to stay in touch with already.  **************************************************  if you're interested in hearing me continue to natter on...  at my best i'm social glue, bringing people together in fun, warm, meaningful ways. i'm a builder/innovator/critic/idealist. i get easily invested and try to improve whatever i'm involved in. i am honest, usually pretty logical (although prone to dreaming), and sometimes impatient.  i love my work but can be easily distracted, love making things, singing goofy songs to my dog, going out with friends, listening to live music, riding my bike, and just taking in and thinking about the goings on of the world. sometimes it's hard for me to say no -- i thrive on being involved and useful. i'm kind of gullible, but have a good sense of humor about it.  i grew up as an agnostic jew -- i'm not religious but it is part of my cultural identity.  yoga helps me focus and renew my optimism when it's strained. i'm a postdoctoral scholar looking for a tenure-track professor job. i write about identity and music, particularly gender and sexuality and the cultural meanings of popular music.  i moved to california in august '09 from the east coast. i live with my smart, feisty, (usually) peaceful little havanese dog, rufus, who takes his companion role very seriously. (good dog!) making my friends and family laugh. i'm a great teacher. i'm pretty excellent in yoga. i make and wear cool stuff. i pull off miraculous things even at the last minute. i'm great at maintaining enthusiasm and commitment (i was a softball team captain for my friends for 3 years in grad school, dragging them out to practice and keeping the team going and cheerful). i have ideas and opinions and am not afraid to share them. i smile at strangers (and then get irritated when they don't smile back). i want to do good things for the world, even if that means breaking some rules. i love david sedaris' books, judith butler's work inspires me, and i would enroll at hogwarts if i could.  some of my favorite bands: rufus wainwright, ratatat, bjork, elvis costello, girlyman. i'm a classically trained violist in a string quartet with some friends (for fun). i just got a ukulele and am learning to play! friends a sense of purpose mutual respect regular exposure to sunshine my dog a stable place to live identity, how cultures develop categories for what's considered normal, enforce these categories with impunity, and how people rebel.  i wonder what my dog is thinking and how i can make sure he's happy and included.  i worry about the earth and the way we treat it and its occupants, and how the little things i do each day might affect it for better or worse. at the dog park after work, and then having dinner and drinks with friends, or relaxing at home with rufus. too late. i'm looking to fall in love with someone wonderful, but would be happy to make some new (local) friends through this site.  you and i will have a better chance of getting along if you:  -are courageous in your daily personal, emotional life, not via sky diving or constant traveling,  -believe in and actively support the rights of people who have been oppressed in our society,  -are inquisitive, kind, attractive, live nearby, are not religious, and like dogs. (and, obviously, if you want to meet in person),  -and can throw a ball. (sorry, attraction is not rational, i grew up playing softball, and have a dog who likes fetch).  i'm a writer and learn a lot from how people communicate, so i appreciate thoughtful okcupid profiles and messages.\n",

(herzog is still great).  by shows, is that referring to like bands? no, i never see those live. currently listening to: john lennon. la comida favorita: cold pizza is actually not my favorite food, but it does make for a groovy midnight snack. orange juice actually makes my mouth taste weird. sorry i am saying actually so much, actually. no, my favorite food is olives. well, i already know your favorite number is six cupid, but way to cramp my style.  1. god 2. truth 3. honesty 4. love & compassion 5. courage 6. god why i spend so much time thinking about what i'm thinking about  edit: no, that's not true. it's partly true; the other 1/2 of the time i spend just thinking. grounded  edit: not grounded anymore. i have my own place. lookit, i'm all grown up. get back to me  edit: the most private thing i'm willing to admit is that i have something that is very, very private. if you are more adventurous than me  edit: surely, that is a lousy filter. my apologies. \"you should message me if...you like green eggs and ham.\" there that's better.\n",
      "i am an introverted geek/gamer type that loves to read, work in my garden and play video games.  i am graduated with a bs in marine transportation and i also hold a license as a 3rd mate (officer) for shipping, with a lot of other smaller licenses attached to that...  i am a geek with many distractions, from: retro gaming (nes up to xbox, though not 360... and playstation 1 & gamecube) up to newer computer games: league of legends, minecraft and sky rim. i like to read books, and devour as many as is reasonable. (current recommendations: dies the fire by sm stirling and the passage by justin cronin) i like board games: i have a small collection (from monopoly to catan and arkham horror... and you must look up canoe, and staggers... they are amazing and not known by many people). my final hobbies of note: chainmaille, gardening, and cooking. i make jewelery out of various common and precious metals for chainmaille (deviantart: stormashke) (i rarely make armor because it takes so damn long to make), and i like my backyard and will some day soon get involved in gardening and landscaping it! i live alone at the moment: so i cook for myself, and try to keep it balanced meals that are tasty.  i am an introvert that knows it; and try to move out of my comfort zone often. i like attending the ren faire, i love camping, and archery... though finding the time to go camping and hiking is a challenge at the moment (one of the few things i plan ahead for)  i have lots of hobbies, though i tend to either plan far ahead or not at all. i am... doing what i want, with the time i have, before going back to work again... no really: i am job hunting and stressed out by not having a job anymore... but i have enough saved up to take my time searching. juggling, cooking (or so i think), making jewelery, reading, playing the piano (if i already know the song, i am not too great at sight reading) and taking a moment out of the day to relax and enjoy life as it comes :) my eyes are an interesting mix of green and brown that seem to have multiple layers...  aside from that: probably that i am tall = 6'2\"  ... or that i wear glasses? books: (by author or series name) wheel of time, laurell k. hamilton (anita blake or merry gentry series), raymond e feist (the rift war saga), orson scott card (ender's series and red prophet series), mercedes lackey (all of valdemar series, and the elemental masters series), patrick rothfuss(kingkiller chronicles), kate forsyth (witches of eileannean)... sci fi and fantasy novels in general and always finding more  movies: 5th element, matrix, boondock saints, equilibrium, bio dome, the dreamers  video games: (oldest to newest) super mario brothers (nes 1,2,3); zelda (nes), metroid (nes), mckids (nes), anticipation (nes), adventure island (nes), f-zero (snes), sonic (sega all), golden axe (sega), streets of rage (sega), powerstone (1 & 2 dreamcast), banjo kazooie (n64), banjo tooie (n64), snowboard kids (n64), quest 64 (n64), golden eye (n64), mario party (all n64), (most n64 games... its my favorite system), psi-ops (xbox), ddr and karoke revolution (xbox), twisted metal (ps), spyro (ps)... that is enough for now...  shows: firefly, heroes, battlestar gallactica, the big bang theory, dark angel, dexter, dollhouse, dr horrible sing along blog, eureka, fallen, kindred: the embraced, legend of the seeker, merlin, moonlight, star trek (voyager, tng, ds9), torchwood, true blood, warehouse 13, witchblade, terranova.  music: many many dance music dj's... but i also listen to classical and modern music (even country)... the only thing i have little experience with is metal... i know many many musicals, and listen to most everything: when in the mood.... though a \"rap\" mood is rare and almost unheard of.  food: my favorites are sushi and mexican... along with what i cook and enjoy cooking! a sky without stars, a good horizon when out on the ocean (or a good view when ashore), life without friends, a book to get lost in, someone or something to play with ;) and plans for vacation and time off to look forward to  on the more mundane side: 1. an interesting book 2. small breaks from whatever i am doing to appreciate a great view (working on the water: there are many of them) 3. something to drink that isn't water (i am a fan of sun tea, coffee, and juice... and when the sun goes down: alcohol on some nights) 4. texts and calls to/from my family on a daily/every-other-day basis 5. showers 6. sandals philosophic: the cosmic balance and harmony that is present in even the most mundane everyday occurrences.  materialistic: landscaping my backyard and items to fill out my house and backyard... at the moment... a terraced vegetable garden, a hammock nook to read in, a grilling patio set-up, a wood fire'd hot tub, a sectional couch, watching a movie/tv or playing a video game... probably having an adult beverage or a few... either alone or with a few friends.  food for thought: i have this idea that if i go to a bar to meet women (and that they would be enjoying the bar scene) that we would already be starting off on false pretenses: i go to a bar to play pool and hope to meet people, but dislike going because it is cheaper to drink at home with friends and there is more to do at home... so if she likes the bar scene for what it is: it isn't really meeting on common ground... though we would at least both enjoy alcohol? quite a bit! i am open to most questions: if you want to know, just ask... after all: its online dating to begin with! figure out if there is something about me you hate before meeting me.  (...and a non-cop-out answer: as follows) i have a lot of ideas of things to do (fly a kite, go to the hot springs, roller blading etc) that don't get done because i want to go do them with someone; and most of the time no one is as jazzed as i am to go do them... so we end up watching a movie instead.  i have played most sports in the past... and for some reason... i do not understand the appeal of watching a sporting event on tv. i would play it, and i would go to a game to watch it live (though this is something i would do on occasion, not all the time, and mainly because you would want to...)... but there is some disconnect in my head that just does not let me understand the appeal of watching sporting events... (i am not a sporting event fan for the most part, and this tends to confuse me and most other people). you share at least one of my hobbies [even if it is laying back to back to reading books] and hopefully you would be interested in meeting me at some point.  it is polite to respond to messages received: even if the only response is \"not interested\"... we are all on here to weed out the ones we are not compatible with in hopes of finding the one we are... be honest.\n",
      "me? i would say that i am a pretty laid back guy. i don't like ripples in my pond or to cause them for others. i tend to look and find humor in everything, so lets share a laugh or two. trying to move forward, juggling everything that life has been throwing at me, while continuing to take care of business(tcb), for those that have always been my reason for living. not long ago i lost my wife of 26+ years to the cold hands of death. i deal with that loss the best i can everyday, and i do so fairly well. i am not looking for help with this in any way. i have family for that, but a sympathetic word and hug always does wonders(i like hugs) what is/was between her and i, will be so, forever and i am not looking to replace what we had at all. i know how wonderful it is to be in love, and can do so, truly, loyally and passionately.  instead, a new chapter in my life has begun. now, i am hoping to find someone to share the downtime with, to go do something fun with, someone to go on walks with, just sit and talk with, all the stuff like that. i guess to put it short date! making others around me comfortable, and more than likely smiling, other than that, well. . .  hmmmmmm. . . .wink~ you'll see!  just keep in mind that practice makes perfect. that i have noticed them and am smiling at them. books = anything sk currently under the dome. switched to kindle, i like the size and portability, i do miss the smell of the paper though, maybe they should come with a spritzer! movies - all types, suspense especially but, exploding guy stuff, nerd stuff, and yes even \"chick flicks\" can you say fried green tomatoes, . . .um yeah, i'm not going to mention to many more, some of them i can do without, really? really six? the journey that has brought me here today, and where it may lead! these days its mostly watching something netflix sent, streaming a movie or some good cable series. hoping that meeting someone here will turn friday nights into, anything but typical!! followed with not so typical saturdays, sundays. . . . you follow me? really on here? . . . if you, want to message, me, and then i will message you, and then we will be messaging each other, then you, should message me, again, then i could message you, again, and i am pretty sure that's how this works.\n",

      "26 y.o. gay polyamorous male witch and self-professed lifetime geek. i want to write and/or be a professional voice actor someday. i like to talk to people, make friends, and have new experiences; unfortunately, i'm not good at initiating those experiences.  i can be snarky, opinionated, and sarcastic sometimes, but i never really mean anything by it. it's more along the lines of my emotional bent; i feel everything strongly. i'm a bit of a heart-on-my-sleeve kind of guy...consider yourself warned. :p  i am emotional, open-minded, and carefree enjoying it. it's really that simple.  i don't believe in letting ambitions rule/run my life. too many friends of mine who are really good, fun people at heart have let their jobs or careers dictate the rest of their lives. i know money is important, but i don't feel it's right to let it become the be-all and end-all of existence.  yeah, i hold a job like everyone else, but my job's just what i do, not who i am. i love to imagine, write, and tell stories. whether i'm any good or not remains to be seen.  i make a pretty decent listener when it comes to personal problems. sometimes i've even been known to give advice that works! ^_^  persuasive speaking is a skill of mine that comes and goes. generally, if i know i'm right, i can usually at least help people see my side of things, even if i won't change their minds about the subject.  i'm generally a person who likes to go out and have fun. i'm extremely experimental and will try anything once. i haven't actually asked what the first thing other people notice about me is...maybe you could tell me? ^_^ i have been a fan of marvel comics' x-men for most of my life. the movies were a disappointment, but i am extremely knowledgable on the history and lore of the comics and tv shows...and prouder of that fact than i have any right to be. :p  i like to rp a lot. i'm a member of an x-men message board rpg, and really enjoy d&d as well. when i do this, i turn to several sources for ideas, and it helps me become better at what i really love to do.  i love the literary works of diane duane, j.k. rowling (me and everyone else who's ever cracked the spine of a book), david & leigh eddings, and tamora pierce. terry brooks is hit-or-miss, and i thought terry goodkind's books were very good before the political messages derailed the characters.  i am and will always be a shameless fan of traditional animation. the disney animated canon, dreamworks, don bluth...if it's 2-d animation of reasonable quality, chances are i've either seen it or plan to.  i'm gradually collecting the dc animated canon, starting from teen titans and batman: the animated series, which got me started on the canon in general. eventually, i want the superman and justice league series as well...give me time. ^_^  one name comes right to mind when i think of the music i like: darren hayes. i love the soul and spirit he puts into his music, and have ever since savage garden. i'm also a fan of japanese video game composers, like nobuo uematsu and yasunori mitsuda. despite these preferences, i'm fairly eclectic in my musical tastes...as long as it's not rap i'll at least give it a try, and my playlist has over 1,000 songs in it.  i also love video games, specifically rpgs, tournament-style fighters, or old-school action titles. if it has an interesting story or premise, fun gameplay, or even just really cool characters, i'm likely interested. only thing that seriously bugs me is survival horror, but then i can't stand horror in general. :\\ food, water, and shelter are all pretty much givens. people to interact with are also crucial...i don't mind being by myself, but we're social creatures by nature.  the other two things i personally would need to survive are a source of inspiration and an outlet for it...you can make of these last two what you will. ^_^ i tend to try and not dwell on any one topic for too long...otherwise i start getting stuck in a rut. but i am always coming up with new ideas...new spells for my craft, story ideas, character developments for already-existing stories, you get the idea. resting up for work on the weekends. the only time i'm ever really tied up is when i'm at work. i'm actually a lot hornier than i sound on here...sex is never too far from my mind. you want to. oldest response in the book, but i swear, i don't bite.  i'm eager to meet new people, make friends, etc. ^_^ go on, say hi, strike up a convo about something.\n",
      "new note! torchwood is coming back!!! bad wolf is back  i grew up in a mediterranean (italian/portuguese/spanish) cuban american family, i'm a vocalist/artist, and this at times given me the perfect excuse to travel (like i need an excuse), i'm definitely a city, ocean and desert girl. this all has given me an open and adventurous spirit, with more of an east coast and european perspective of the world. i appreciate all aspects of life, the brilliant light and the necessary darkness which sometimes accompanies it. i've got permanent wanderlust.  i've worked very hard to get rid of my demons, and i'm excited to learn things everyday. this keeps my spirit strong and makes for a generally good attitude without going pollyanna.  i'm at a point, now, where i'm comfortable enough with myself to consider a possible relationship. i'm very happy now, but i'm ready to love the right person and be loved.  so much is about music and treating myself like i'm my best friend. i've got room for more company if it's uplifting. that's really much of the truth of who i am. and of course the impetus for many of my adventures.  i am happy, curious, and adventurous singing, teaching, traveling when i can (usually to sing and teach). i've reached the point i've been working toward, which is feeding my need for making music, comfortable with the fact that i sometimes do other things to support that.  i also work part time as a personal assistant and petsitter. that also fulfills other parts of my spirit. it's fun to be able to do it all. to be in the spotlight and then to help other people be center stage in their lives too. i'm making lots of new music, and i can also turn around and be the go-to person for others to make their dreams come true as well.  i'm stretching my musical boundaries from resonant space performance to industrial and electronic experimentation, improvisation and cool new things coming my way.  i guess you can tell, that my music is the most important thing for me right now.  i am very fortunate to be still having wonderful surprises and a new adventure each day. voicework. i can make angel sounds and then peel the paint off the walls. really the sounds, not the paint peel.  i like taking care of people and lifting them up.  seeing the spirit and light in my world and letting it inform my attitude. keeping an open mind but still pragmatic when necessary. just enough.  right, enough of this.  one more thing. i have friends who tell me that they want to be on my team if the apocalypse comes. and there you go. or should i say, where ever you go, there you are. not really sure. doesn't it depend on each person i meet? i read as much as i can. keeping up this list is crazy.  music: it varies. today i was listening to smetana and dvorak, yesterday i was listening to patty smith and gene krupa. i'm a musician, so anything from vaughan williams, saint saens and antheil to throbbing gristle, todd rundgren and the residents. and i like listening to my own music, but sometimes i scare myself.  i've been cooking a lot and enjoy making food for other people. they seem to like it a lot. lately i just think of something and decide to cook it. i like all kinds of food and cooking, but really, going to tamales bay for oysters is my nirvana. my voice and music (ok 2 things there) my mother (she's very cool and sings too) my bicycle friends who never let me down. dancing pretty much anywhere i want to, body and mind. the feel and sound of the world. well, not any one thing. and i prefer to do while i think.  how great life is.  and...thinking about nothing at all. alive and kicking. if i admitted anything, it wouldn't be private, now would it? you are a city person, intelligent, consider yourself a bit out of the norm, inherently kind, willing to acknowledge the existence of darkness, but live in the light. open minded and ready to take a few chances. or won't mind when i do. can appreciate the silly. sensuous and curious in mind and body.  someone who finds it easy to encourage their partner and is receptive to being encouraged. happy when the other is succeeding and understands how that lifts everyone up.  you're in the arts. it just seems to work better if we speak the same language and have that perspective. you might consider yourself a bit of an outsider and are fine with it. flexible enough to consider both \"high\" art and \"outsider\" art.  knows how to dress up or down. on the slim side or in fairly healthy shape (no buddha bellies). you don't have to be massively buff, though. i'm an urban cyclist, and trying to keep in shape,so i'd like to meet someone who still is a bit \"athletic\" you are still vibrant and relatively young looking. it sounds like a lot to ask, but why not? wouldn't you?  and you'd like to have fun. yes, fun is allowed... there is so much to do, right here, right now. dinner? concerts? bowling? shooting pool? music? or absolutely nothing, staying home and being alone together.  you would like have and be a monogamist partner/lover/friend who has his/her own goals and life and would be secure enough to not need to be joined at the hip. you understand that being able to rely on someone is very different than co-dependency. you agree with the possibility that commitment and dedication can be accomplished while still encouraging individuality  you have integrity, and strong ethics.  one more thing. these kind of things are who you are now, not who you want to be.  and realize that this kind of public expression is no substitute for in person meeting.  one more thing, please don't contact me if you are seriously and dogmatically religious. it just wouldn't work out.\n",

      "insert tape and press play.  when i was growing up, my parents left me on the side of the freeway, saying that maybe another family would adopt me. twice.  through high school, i pretended to be as stupid as possible, so that exceeding expectations was easy. in college, i flipped it around, acted pretentious as possible. today, i try to have some middle ground. i speak as simply as i can, and make an attempt to hear other people.  my close friends think it's odd that i identify as a loner. but of course, they see me only in the times when i'm inviting them out for activities. i'm comfortable with them, in 'on' mode, and on these occasions if someone happens to engage me i'm excited and am happy to talk at great length about seemingly anything.  most of the time i'm by myself, though, and i feel like an alien observer. at a bar or a show, i'm quiet, i eavesdrop obsessively, i make mental notes, intuit ideas about people, and file away. i rarely intrude. i don't like to impose myself on other people.  i'm skeptical about my place in other people's lives, like a bad piece of furniture in an otherwise immaculate room. so when i'm single, i stay single for a while. dating puts me on edge, perhaps because it's been a all or nothing proposition--i think i've been on about 8 first dates, half of which never had a second, and half of which became relationships lasting 1-3 years.  someone great in that regard will surely come along, they always have. but in recent years i've become more open and the number of activities i like to do has outgrown the friends i have to do them with. and since there are a lot of amazing people out there--you may be one of them--and i'd like to get to know them without it being a high pressure proposition. so that's what i'm proposing. for money, i work for a website that specializes in movie reviews. i mostly work from home and spend an inordinate amount of time in pajama sets. as a result, i like to dress up a bit when i go out. oddly, people frequently ask if i just came from the office.  for fun, i write narcissistic 'reviews' of concerts and show recommendations for the bay guardian. it only pays when i do interviews and print features, but i generally get more free tickets than i can handle. so i have that going for me, which is nice. i also take photos at most of the shows, although i'm not as great as i'd like to be, and the double duty can be taxing, i'd like to collaborate with an aspiring photographer, if anyone is interested.  i housesit a lot this time of year. it's fun to pretend i have someone else's home and life. also, to play with their pets.  just got back from a backpacking trip to the trinity alps. definitely want to squeeze in a few more trips--like thousand island lake--before the summer ends, but also do some more relaxing activities. floating down a river with a cooler by my side sounds nice. good compared to what? i cook and run on a daily basis. sometimes i bake. in high school i rowed on a crew team, and recently have returned to being occasionally bad at indoor rock climbing.* some random things i've done include interning at an orphanage in japan and volunteering at san quentin as an adviser for inmates approaching parole. i wish i could say i was good at the drums, but mostly i hit them with sticks, although i've played a couple shows with a friend's band. oh, and i've attempted stand-up comedy a few times.  *it seems like everyone rock climbs at this point. given the competitive nature with which people in the bay area approach hobbies, i can only assume that in a few years the default will be parkour or squirrel suit diving. turn tape over.  my lips quiver when i'm nervous, like i'm suppressing a smile. anyone can make a list. let's play pub trivia and put our tastes to the test.  but here is my most recent activity: the sci-fi issue of the new yorker, hundred years of solitude. moonrise kingdom, prometheus. adventure time, the thick of it. tomas barfod, dent may. beet sauerkraut, potato tacos. if you're not materialistic and don't want to list abstract qualities either, this question is boring. so i'm going to answer something else instead.  best compliment i've ever received: years back, when i was laid off from construction and working at a grocery store to get by, my coworker jamil invited me to his house after our shift to smoke and play some video game. we were sitting in the living room when his baby's mother came in, and jamil introduced me by saying, 'this is ryan. he looks like that, but he's different.' i don't know in what particular way he meant, but generally, he was exactly right. when women answer 'you should message me if' with 'you are not a serial killer,' are there ever guys wearing hockey masks and sharpening knives at the other end who read it and get a surge of disappointment? since i set my own schedule, a friday night could be any night. but good shows tend to be booked on friday/saturday, so there's a higher probability that i would be out listening to music. i know that for better or worse women on okcupid can get flooded with messages, and that the optimal strategy for men is to simply contact as many as possible, but i'm a bit reserved with messaging women on here, for fear of being perceived as a creepy pervbro.  i'd prefer to just cut through the weird projection we all do on here, make a plan to do an activity we'd both enjoy, and put the pressure/expectations to the side. maybe we could be friends or something more, but we need to see if we mesh outside of the matrix first. too much of this feels like posturing.  so, if you like my face or my words (because honestly, what else do you have to go on?) feel free to reach out. you're my huckleberry.  you'd like to do any of the following activities, in addition to obvious things like go to a show or movie:  drink bloody marys and do the nyt crossword puzzle on a sunday morning.  explore the abandoned warehouse on the water in point richmond that's completely covered in graffiti on the inside.  get a headphone splitter, lay down in a park, and play dueling playlists.  bowling at albany bowl late on a sunday night.  go to a really crowded public place and pretend to have a very loud, heated argument involving all kinds of embarrassing details.  play scrabble, have beers, and optionally smoke english tobacco that smells like roasted marshmallows out of a cheap corn cob pipe at the pub on solano ave.  go to hotsy totsy in the late afternoon when the pool table is free and the old bartender makes strong, cheap drinks.  pub trivia night, any night of the week.  get some thai or indian food, and tell the waiter 'hella hot' when they ask 'how spicy?'  take pretentious portraits of one another in ridiculous outfits.  steal copper from model homes.  watch people brave the comedy open mic at brain wash on thursdays.  take in a classic or b-movie at the castro.  ride bikes by the bay and have lunch at the bulb.  take in the jean paul gaultier exhibit at the de young.  running, hiking, rock climbing, rollerball, etc.\n",
      "hi! i love cooking, exploring san francisco, dining out, reading, walking, running and am just now getting into yoga. i moved to san francisco about a year ago from a smaller state, and have fallen in love with the area. i am learning to get around but would love to have someone special to explore the city with. i enjoy going to farmer's markets, and my new goal is to find my favorite dive bar.  i am adventurous, witty, and relatively unhip i work a lot, but i'm not a workaholic, i'm also going to grad school, which makes it sound like i don't have much free time. in all actuality, since i should probably study more, but really enjoy having a life, i make sure i have an adequate amount of time to go do a lot of fun things. making homemade cinnamon buns (i only do that for really special people though). i'm also fabulous at travel planning. probably my laugh. my most recent favorite books are the power of now, and the alchemist.  my favorite movies-hhmm...the big lebowski, dodge ball, little miss sunshine, lars and the real girl, bacchanales sexuelles, across the universe.  music i am all over the board with. i love sam cooke, amos lee, sergio mendes, melissa etheridge, anthony hamilton. as long as it isn't serious thrasher music i can find a way to like most music.  food-oh lord, one of the top reasons i love san francisco! topping my favorites is vietnamese. basically i love it all though, if it isn't deep fried or 100% tofu i'm in. french, japanese (sushi=love), moroccan, burmese, filippino, indonesian (i believe there is a theme going on here). i'm not an overly picky eater, i love vegetables, and get slightly annoyed by people who are profoundly picky. travel is my crack-so definitely travel. books down duvets travel no friday night is typical. but, if i'm not traveling, i'm probably doing something that i found in the guardian or the sf weekly with some unsuspecting friend. or, just staying at home and cooking dinner and watching a movie. i don't particularly enjoy getting into a routine of doing any one thing on a particular day. i'm not all that private of a person you are adventurous, witty and enjoy life.\n",
      "i'm pretty good.  ...i'm really good, actually. you should probably know up front between being crazy about flightpattern and nothing_changes and keeping up with my own busy life, i'm not really looking to meet new people on okc. really, i'm only here in case anyone interested in the gentlemen above want to come spy on me or ask me questionswhich i readily invite.  if you're a dude who would like to go for a drink, i am flattered but i will probably ignore you. no dis. dividing my time between politely asking the entire universe to make sense of itself for me and conversely reveling in the fact that it doesn't matter. and sometimes i do weirdy movement / balance / dance experiments in my living room. parallel parking, handwriting, drinking coffee, nuance, being married and still being fun and interesting, walking in high heels, losing my cell phone in my apartment is that i tell my whole life story in my expressions, and i sometimes take interesting liberties with the english language. the wire, modern family, so you think you can dance; 90s punk rock, hipster indie-pop (especially that shit that's happening right now that sounds like the beach boys on lithium), scissor sister; hedwig and the angry inch; the death and life of great american cities, the politics of public space, raw food cookbooks; tomato sauce, the perfect tirimisu, things with basil, vegetable juice.  i am really interesting, you guys. my husband. he knows me and gets me and shows up for me and pushes me to be my true authentic self or whatever but doesn't do the work for me, dusts me off when i fall down and cheers for me when i get up. he gives me space to do me, because he knows exactly who he married, and he usually makes sure i eat dinner. seriously, that guy is awesome.  something to hang upside down from. sometimes i spend a considerable amount of time and energy pursuing upside-down-things; other times, i just need to knee-hang from a pull-up bar between meetings to get through a day. it's not luck that i work at a place where this is possible, it's a condition of my full-time employmentand it's not a always convenient requirement, i can tell you that.  shampoo. if i couldn't wash my hair, i couldn't have hair, and my forehead / nose combination does not support a buzz cut. despite a ferocious affinity for short-short-haired chicks that can pull it off with a fantastically juxtaposed doe-eyed softness, i concede that i myself am not among them. this is a limitation i am willing to work with, but it does make shampoo pretty mandatory.  a super-juicy medium-point black roller-ball ink pen. my weapon of choice is a black fine-tipped uniball vision classic, but if you loan me something that writes a fatter line or writes smoother in an uncoated-pressboard-covered spiral notebook, i will probably forget to give it back.  black lululemon leggings. i know that sounds super pretentious, and if it is, i will just have to own it because its true. i spend at least 4 days a week in these things, and they deal with all of my flailing and bonking into things and upside-down-ing and constant laundering and still make me feel just a little bit like a superhero every time i put them on. they're also a staple of my eccentric post-apocalypse art teacher aesthetic.  making out. holy crap, i love making out. how to frame the problem, motivations and priorities of relevant stakeholders, steps to doneness, finding patterns in the entire fucking universe, my non-monogamous relationship and its various players and/or opportunities, interesting things to do with the intersections of movement, image-capture and performance wishing i was better at planning for my social life i might like you just a little better if you can work in a touch of d for my touch of s.  also, you should know that i struggle to appreciate facial hair. every now and then, someone shows up and makes it make sense, but for the most part i'm really not that into it. shrug. bad news for me, really, because it is fucking rampant lately. you have a penchant for autonomy and communication, you have some experience with (or at least interest in) non-monogamy, you can separate the friendship from the sex but you really like both, you can understand that this is just a little something on the side but still respect and enjoy it for what it is, you love making out and / or drinking coffee.\n",

      "3 random things about me: 1. i can get ready for a night out in under 10 mins. (amazing i know, you can applaud now) 2. i'm scared of heights, so i went skydiving. 3. i can make you laugh in 0.63 seconds flat with just one look. believe it.  my humor usually runs towards witty sarcasm and the \"that's what she said!\" kind. i love being outdoors, all kinds of water sports, jet-skiing, kayaking, white water rafting. i'm a runner when it's sunny, playing tennis when it's really sunny. when the weather turns my thoughts turn to skiing. activity-wise you name it - i've done it or tried it.  (this may sound fake but its not, test me if you want) i really love sports, playing it and watching it. i know what rbi means, i know the difference between a point guard and power forward, a 2pt conversion is too risky but damn exciting. i love all sports, but hockey has my heart. some girls buy shoes, i buy season tickets.  i definitely have the travel bug, doesn't matter if it's halfway across the world or just crossing state lines. i admit i've called in \"sick\" on more than one occasion for a weekend adventure. its a good thing i love my job otherwise coming back would be too painful.  i'm kind of a nerd when it comes to the things i like. you can almost say i'm from a different era. i love old movies and old songs, think rat pack and gone with the wind. i'm currently collecting old movie posters and all kinds of literature from about 50-70 years ago. okay enough about me, tell me about you! gathering more new experiences and enjoying the ones i love. parallel parking. for an asian female that's like winning the lottery. every time. i'm an asian that is terrible at math. i've shocked people speechless. books are like children...how can you pick a favorite??! okay here are some of my oldies but goodies. to kill a mockingbird, pereira declares, catch 22, all the james patterson books, wuthering heights, jane eyre, memoirs of a geisha, phantom of the opera, time traveler's wife, naamah's kiss, inheritance trilogy. i've just finished the song of ice and fire series, and hunger games. working on the anne rice books.  i like action and comedy movies, rom-coms are pretty nice too. all the batman movies, inception, gone with the wind, citizen kane, memento, butterfly effect, last of the samurai, memoirs of a geisha. i watch horror movies only after they come out on dvd and only in the daytime. absolute favorite would probably be godfather i...no ii....wait i...damn...  food...well its a good thing i'm not allergic to anything lol! i usually pick pizza, pasta, or sushi more often than not. going to go beyond the normal, friends/family, phone, air/water, food cliches...  romantic songs and movies kettlecorn (more like 'crack' corn) hockey the cold side of a fluffy pillow skiing love what to do next. if i'm staying in, i am mostly trying to catch up on laundry and cleaning my place, usually with the tv on. i get home late more often than not, so i don't pay enough attention to my place.  if i'm going out, it's usually dinner and drinks with friends. once in awhile i'm at a club, but that's usually for a friend's birthday or other special occasion. i have a disappearing/reappearing birthmark. you'd like some laughs! you're looking for a great friend. you can make me laugh so hard and so long that i can skip my aerobics workout the next morning. and willing to meet instead of sending 748 emails.\n",

      "i moved out from the beast coast to the best coast in the late 1990s. i'm a news and political information junkie. i like biodiesel, venues with music and alcohol, long walks in the grocery store under florescent lights, and correcting entries in wikipedia, not in that particular order. please keep in mind that this profile summary is constantly edited, usually very early in the morning during fits of insomnia. i'll respond to email if you want detailed answers to specific questions.  update: 17 april 2012  i am currently not using a car since i can commute much closer to home now. also, if you've ever lived in san francisco, you'd appreciate that the sfmta/dpt is more about inducing headaches and writing tickets instead of actual law enforcement. it would be cheaper for me in the long run at this point to rent a car when i really need it. i work mostly in financial services, but i often also do legal support, political campaigning, and other things on the side. one of these days, i'll finish my law degree. being malleable and flexible, a skill which i have finely honed out of necessity to fit the times. i also have the ability to be serious and funny, as well as urbane and profane, simultaneously, even in the same sentence. many people have told me that they usually first notice that i have a hearty laugh, a nice smile, and a large forehead. i'm an omnivore when it comes to things cultural or culinary.  since i've been constantly asked for more specifics about my musical tastes, i'll just start with shows that i've seen live, in reverse chronological order: bruce springsteen and the e street band, iggy pop and the stooges, pentagram, they might be giants, shonen knife, my life with the thrill kill kult, ratatat, the faint, tv on the radio, cornershop, beck, duran duran, etta james, lauren hill, the roots (with and without rahzel), black sabbath (full original line-up), motorhead, war, genitorturers, run dmc, public enemy, nine inch nails, metallica, neil young, smashing pumpkins, tool, grateful dead, traffic, david bowie, the who, nashville pussy, ministry, bad brains, patti labelle, pigface, kmfdm, rage against the machine, cypress hill, mighty mighty bosstones, living colour, primus, radiohead, dizzy gillespie. i am missing quite a few and i didn't list any of the many splintered genres of electronic dance music that i listen to whose names i don't recall. additionally, i've been to a couple of operas. this is just a partial list that represents my musical tastes and i posted this so that you can get a general idea of what i am into, which is very diverse. i remember seeing an interview with quincy jones where he was asked why he constantly changed his musical style and he responded by saying, \"if you're a musician, you've got to surrender to the beat.\" i like that philosophy.  if the opportunity is there, i really like to embarrass myself slightly by singing karaoke. i always try to pick songs within my range, though, for the sake of other people.  there are very few foods which i discriminate against and i think watching a lot of hours of the travel channel is making me open to exploring more options for my personal cuisine and reconsider food that i used to avoid at all costs.  when it comes to films, i have a preference for any works by alan smithee. food clothing shelter clean air access to the internet either via my phone or computer my ability to reason ...how much i don't get to go skiing or snowboarding enough.  ...if there are people who write other people's dating website profiles professionally.  i also think about all of these invitations that i'm still getting to \"white parties\" (where people dress all in white, not necessarily a party where everybody is \"white\"). i thought that got played out back when \"diddy\" was still known as \"puff daddy\". there is really no such thing as a typical friday night for me. sometimes i'm at a dive bar, if i am not working. i prefer not to go to dress to impress or mandatory cover charge venues unless it's a really special occasion. i don't really follow any particular scene; i go to a variety of venues of different genres at least once a week. after ridiculing people for years for playing social networking games like the ones on zynga, i started playing one of them on a regular basis in late 2011.  i did not realise that the term \"motherfuckers\" refers to those who fuck their own mothers until recently. i really always thought that it referred to those who fuck mothers no matter who they may be.  i naively thought that by answering all the sillier and more superficial questions that there was really some sort of esoteric formula that was being used to formulate a match and they weren't just there for my amusement. you feel like half the questions you answered were kind of silly and you can identify with anthony bourdain in this clip: also, message me if instead of believing that no publicity is bad publicity, that you believe that having no publicity at all is bad publicity.\n",
      "hi guys! i'm a normal, masculine, guy who would rather spend a night kissing and cuddling with a cool guy than be in a bar. i'm educated and know what i want. playing gay games aint' part of my scene. a busy professional who needs a good distraction. like good food, dogs, pizza, dogs who like pizza, the gym (work out 6-7 xs a week), weekend trips to lake tahoe, good music, jazz and wine, and fun, low key tmes. i have a sarcastic, funny streak about me and will keep you entertained. or at least awake.  for me, a sense of humor and romance required. i know..those are hard to find but i'll keep looking. work. professional. love what do. bringing the arts alive. kissing. i'm a certified master kisser. i have to check credentials. sorry. it's the law. my smile. movies: 9 to 5, all of me, chicago, but i'm a cheerleader shows: hardly watch tv..loved bsg. why isn't \"solid gold\" still on? food: pizza. italian. chinese. thai. did i mention pizza? good friends working out lake tahoe sunsets sf good guys quite times fog horns og the arts vew of marin from the top of pacific heights hmmm..that's more than six. ok..i'm greedy. my future out with buds for some fun. or at home. see..a man of contradictions. i work. a lot. distract me. congrads! you made it to the end. you must either be really bored or you might be interested. if so, message me. i don't bite. often.\n",
      "hi! there really isn't much for me to say except i started this to meet different people to see what comes up. i love to laugh and enjoy great company, talking about what is going on with our lives as well as discussing current events.  i enjoy taking pictures of everything unique and fascinating. i love to travel and try to plan at least one trip per year, so far mostly to parts of asia but i have been to the bahamas and hawaii and i must say, those are some amazing destinations.  i'm always optimistic and looking at the bright-side of things because let's face it, life can be pretty harsh but with a positive attitude, it gets better! i get excited when going on adventures and finding new places to visit with new people to talk to. i love to try anything new at least once and if i don't like it, at least i can say i gave it a good attempt but it just isn't for me. i can also be a little bit nerdy at times (what can i say, i love learning about new things!)  i don't really expect anyone to get a good grasp of the kind of person i am just through this self-summary because profiles can only hold so much. you learn so much more through a conversation with another person which i hope we get the chance to do.  i am determined, spontaneous, and optimistic with a little bit of hopeless romanticism thrown in the mix i came back from studying abroad in the uk. i miss it dearly and plan to return one day to see the friends i made once again. working in the port of oakland at one of the terminals and love how my co-workers always make me laugh everyday. i'm not a huge party person but i love to celebrate special occasions. working on taking care of my family and supporting my best friends. finding the positive in all the negative. i like to see the brightside of things. i guess you can call me an optimist. i'll try to make you feel better, and even if i fail, i'm pretty sure i can make you laugh by doing something goofy and off-the-wall  i'm also really good with working with kids. it's not necessarily my goal to become a teacher but after working with students for so many years, i have a new appreciation for life being seen through their eyes. i guess you can say i'm a pretty good confidante since they trust me enough to hang around them (since i'm \"old\" to them haha)  oh and i'm really good at cooking and making homemade gifts for friends and family. i love surprising people ;] probably me laughing. i tend to laugh a lot at funny or cheesy jokes. i like to laugh with my friends and make them laugh as well. when i went abroad to study, many people said i had a very cute laugh, that it was different. i can accept that. =d  also my hair, i tend to keep changing it just for fun ^_^ books: complete works of sherlock holmes, bridget jone's diary, something borrowed, a walk to remember, pride and prejudice, kite runner, beowulf, the poisonwood bible, cat's cradle, angels and demons  movies: a walk to remember, pride and prejudice, thank you for smoking, roman holiday, breakfast at tiffany's, to kill a mockingbird, breakfast club, sixteen candles, transformers, pirates of the caribbean, love me if you dare, kung fu hustle, fight club, 300, star trek, sex and the city: the movie, despicable me, easy a, any genre really  music: r&b mostly but i'll listen to anything. ultimate fave is anything by michael jackson. currently loving kate voegele, ne-yo, rihanna, michael buble, justin timberlake, adele, owl city, one republic, and the script, glee soundtracks (yes i'm a gleek!)  tv: how i met your mother, supernatural, glee, the vampire diaries, drop dead diva, psych, leverage, whitney, sex and the city, castle, grey's anatomy, rookie blue, bones, the big bang theory, royal pains, warehouse 13, eureka, ncis  food: um, pretty much anything. i particularly love authentic exotic food but american burgers and fries will do just fine! 1. family 2. friends 3. music 4. cell phone 5. good food 6. laughter the future and all the possibilities, because they are endless and i want to take every chance i get to enjoy it all.  i'm also always thinking about the next big project i'll undertake. either at home staying in and watching a good movie, chilling with close friends, out for dinner, or just going for a walk. i tend to play things by the ear and wait to see what comes up i like to sing, mostly to myself. i tend to have songs stuck in my head and i basically hum or sing them to myself quietly.  i guess that i would like to meet someone on here to.  oh and i'm deathly afraid of spiders. you want to meet somebody new and just want to chat. if you want to get to know someone who loves to learn and enjoys a good conversation while still having a silly side. if you read this and thought \"hey, this person is pretty cool to talk to and hang out with\" and you don't mind my nerdy/dorky tendencies from time to time, then by all means, send me a message or two! i can be serious when need be but otherwise, i'm usually a laid-back kind of person who likes to joke around with friends and have a good time. like i said earlier, talking and conversing/messaging is a better way to get to know someone instead of just reading a person's profile over and over again (and i love to make good conversation with just about anyone). new friends are always awesome to have and who knows? maybe it can lead to something more....=)\n",

      "what to say....  i am who i am. who am i? well, i can't tell you that in a few simple words, it can only be shown. however, i've come across some descriptors that do a decent enough job of placing me into little boxes, so people can understand me a bit better.  adjectives: dependable, calm, methodical, patient, hardworking, ambitious, conventional, steady, modest, logical, resolute, tenacious, cheerful, popular, quick-witted, changeable, earthy, perceptive, talkative, agile mentally and physically, magnetic, intelligent, astute, flexible, open-minded, magnanimous, stately, vigorous, strong, self-assured, proud, noble, direct, dignified, zealous, fiery, passionate, decisive, pioneering, ambitious, generous, loyal, righteous, sincere, sympathetic, mild-mannered, shy, artistic, creative, gentle, compassionate, understanding, mothering, determined, peaceful, generous, seeks security. can be stubborn, narrow-minded, materialistic, rigid, demanding, fickle, arrogant, anxious, rude, gullible, stubborn, arrogant, imperious, tyrannical, demanding, eccentric, grandiloquent and extremely bombastic, prejudiced, dogmatic, over-bearing, violent, impetuous, brash, moody, indecisive, over-passive, worrier, pessimistic, over-sensitive, complainer, wise.  hope that helps. oh, and i'm a male lesbian as well. if you don't know what that is, look it up. urban dictionary actually has a relatively good definition (the 1st two are the best, the rest, not so much). getting my bachelors in photography. either going to immediately pursue a career in photography, or going to attempt my phd in cultural/socio anthropology. pretty much anything i put my heart and mind to. ask them books: j.k. rowling, douglas adams, clive cussler, lewis carrol, c.s. lewis, and many others.  movies: to many to list effectively  shows: south park, the walking dead. don't really watch television, so my shows list is rather short.  music: bleh, i can't even begin to pick favorites.  food: no favorite. six things i can not live without: brain activity, blood, food, water, air, shelter.  six things i would not want to live without: music, my camera, my guitar, the ability to see, the ability to speak, and the ability to hear/listen. everything in general, as well as whatever randomness decides to pop into my mind at any given moment. there are no \"typical\" days for me. every day is a new day, and brings new things. i have no private things that are in need of admitting. i keep myself an open book, so others may peruse if they wish. ask and you shall know. if you don't like it, or think it makes me too easy, then you are both wrong, and need to look for someone else. one who will hide things and lie to you, and play your little cat and mouse game, for i am not he. if you find me interesting and want to know more, or if you just want to chat. either or are good reasons.\n",
      "raised in la (not by choice); living in san francisco (by choice). i'm a happy camper. i love my job, as it affords me the time and resources to do whatever the hell i want. i am as loyal as a black lab to my friends, but i don't suggest crossing me- when i bite, i bite hard. just be real and we'll be fine.  things i like: all sorts of music, from madonna to blonde redhead; reading, from voltaire to frank herbert; dancing, from the dna lounge to the stork club. long conversations, mimosas on sundays, late nights on saturday, getting weird and abstruse with friends, friendly bitchiness, irrational shopping sprees followed by an expensive dinner, and passionate dismissals of heteronormativity.  i'm interested in making a connection with the following: responsible hedonists, friends of fashion, language mavens, artists lacking 'artitude', admirers of good clean fun, and thinking agnostics. oh yeah, and if you're cute, that would be rad.  i am honest, friendly, and fun hopefully i'm taking my passion and making it work for me. learning languages, turning the page, throwing things together and making friends. oh and most importantly, cutting hair. my hair and outfit? seriously. dune, l' etranger, candide, querelle, in cold blood, a scanner darkly, giovanni's room, do androids dream of electric sheep, disco bloodbath.  willy wonka and the chocolate factory (not the abomination with johnny depp), the omen, rosemary's baby, the exorcist, needful things, blade runner, dune, all aliens movies.  i like any music one can dance to. period.  i'm blessed and i love all food. ipod, sunglasses, alone time, books, language, friends. fashion, hair, people in general, and my friends. hanging out with friends. sometimes i wish eating were more of a luxury than a need. you know yourself.\n",
      "just when i think i have some free time- it eludes me.  i respond better when asked specific questions, or during actual conversations. if you want to get to know me, just ask me something. i wont bite. or maybe i will. that fact, my friend, depends entirely on you.  i lived in costa rica in the rural mountains for a short time, with a host family that doesn't speak english. there i learned that cold showers, cockroaches, and heaps of rice are quite alright. i also hope to some day bring to light the struggle the indigenous community there is facing.  i play soccer on a women's league team (co-captain, woot) . i'm a much nicer/happier person in-season.  i don't like living without a dog.  i just graduated cal with a masters in... i say, storytelling.  i find myself compelled and intrigued by different lifestyles. i was raised in the midwest, grew in california, and studied in nyc... on one hand i love the excitement, opportunity, and accessibility of a city, but the peacefulness, calm, and adventure of the country. i both want to be a total earth-ie living on the land growing my own food and not needing to rely on the 'modern world.' on the other hand i enjoy the convenience of technology and find myself lost in the internet quite regularly. some may see this as some form of bipolarity, but if you jive with the thought of doing/having both (which is entirely possible given my career path), we'd get along peachily. yes, i just said peachily. graduated from uc berkeley grad school of journalism- in documentary production. on to my next phase.  temporarily living in san rafael, for reasons i'd rather explain not-in a profile. start work soon in the east bay, though. thinking about where to move to in the fall/winter. i'm good at a lot of things, i'm really good at a handful. please don't mistake this for bragging as i'll be the first to admit i am not perfect. i take great pleasure in the moments where someone figures out what i'm good at.  cooking is one of those things that i'll tell you up front.  i will also tell you - though you probably already know - i'm tops at over-using ellipses and parentheticals [struggles to not put them right here]. shit. at the gas station (9/25/10): \"excuse me miss, how are you? i don't mean to sound like a creepy stranger at a gas station but i just have to tell you that your gluteous maximus is amazing! you have a good night\" ... what a way to end the night...  a friend of mine, a first year in my grad program, tells me that she wants my badonk. my hips don't lie. a) undecided...history of love, confessions of max tivoli, the road to mars...i'm always sourcing new reads though i've been less likely to read them lately because of thesis work. i look forward to getting back to a time where i can read more.  b) several for many different reasons... hitchcock, kubrick, goddard, lang, truffaut, cuarn (my home boy), anything pixar, + foreign films, (this is not an exclusive list) etc. i love movies - after all, i work in film/tv. i watch a healthy amount of documentaries  c) phoenix, sia, andrew bird, andrew london, as tall as lions, blonde redhead, blue merle, bon iver, bright eyes, brmc, david mayfield parade, elephant parade, emily haines, eric sharpe and the magnetic zeroes, feist, florence and the machine, inara george, joanna newsome, laura viers, lilly allen, lykke li, mates of state, matt and kim, metric, metric mile, miho hatori, massive attack, *matthew & the atlas*, radiohead, railroad earth, rocketship, the ruby suns, sigur ros, si*s, spoon, the stranglers, the submarines, sufjan, tower of foil, tv on the radio, yeasayer, elijah aaron, etc. this changes often. i'm too lazy to update it all and half the people will be people you've likely never heard of. so at that, i end there.  d) i love to cook, and will make anything. especially things that i don't eat. i like to cook seafood, but i wont eat it. i live to feed others, it makes me happy. but as far as food, i like indian, \"costa rican\", strange and unusual things from varied cultures...saffron rose ice cream!  but realistically, i try to eat well, and by that i mean i get my daily intake of foods from the green range of the color wheel. i worked for an organic foods stand at a local farmers' market in middle and high school. knowing farmers has guided my eating habits. head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes what to put in this box. not really.  figuring out how i could travel more often. trying to win trips to do so, and being mildly successful at it.  my next doc project.  what to do next in life.  who i'll meet. out and or in. or in and out. or out and about? i like contests. i used to think that was pretty nerdy but after ppl find out what i've won they tend to respect this hobby. though it's also a mini addiction, there are worse addictions that don't involve a year supply of bananas.  i want to buy property...now. i only really edit this page when i'm tired of the same jokes messaged to me over and over again over some specific thing that i write. so... be creative. i appreciate creativity.  smoking is a deal breaker for me. sorry! you're free to do what you want, i won't nag. but i choose not to deal with it personally, so if you smoke and i like you, then i have no choice but to be around it. so... i just don't start down that path. cool beans?  and yes, i do judge your grammar. i won't say it, but it's happening.\n",

'the grifters'. 'big trouble in little china'. 'block party'. 'a christmas story'. the last two movies i saw were unexpectedly satisfying: 'zombieland' and 'district 9'. music: i love music, especially if it's live! as long as it's not mainstream pop or country or having to pay $100 to see crosby, stills and nash. or even $35. half of my music collection is in spanish, portuguese, or french. serious sweet spot fer hip-hop even though i keep getting stuck in the 90s. fave live magical musical moments: ozomatli at snocore 2001(?), bajofondo at stern grove, ojos de brujo/zap mama/blackalicious all at bimbo's, yerba buena at the independent. omar sosa three feet in front of me at the elbo room. the first treasure island music festival rocked. i must go back to new orleans!!! food: i'll eat just about anything although watching andrew zimmern's bizarre foods makes me queasy. i love the bay area's quality scene! the arts. friends and family. good, wholesome food. the music that makes my butt groove. a progressive place to call a hometown! how to combine passion with the necessity of work. chillin'. i tend to go out during the week. dunno. i gotta little freak goin' on? you feel like catching a beer and talking.\n",
      "i'm a displaced michigander, having moved to the bay area in september 2009 for a job. still getting used to the culture out here and having far too many hobbies, i like to float around and try new things. i'm a person who will try just about anything once, just for the first-hand experience. when i'm not traveling, i like to spend my time out dancing, snowboarding, climbing, dinking around with electronic music, or cooking the weirdest shit i can f up. certainly haven't decided anything definitive about life yet, so just kind of dealing with things as they come. rocking out in san francisco! just beginning to learn to spin fire, getting into slowing down a little and reading, planning a few paintings, beginning planning for burning man next year. . . i'm hoping to build a 2-3 story pagoda. . . snowboarding, being serious, listening, dancing, stressing, trying on every new hobby under the sun and then some. genuine nature and eyes, or so i've been told. i haven't read enough books in my life, which is a terrible waste. just finished the book thief, friggin amazing. big fan of zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, reading papers on sociology and psychology, trying to learn german, catch 22, animal farm, old man and the sea, ender's game.  movies change all the time. ones i can remember: out cold, wristcutters (a love story), american beauty, snatch, boondock saints, star wars, up (ok, any pixar), 40 year old virgin, forgetting sarah marshall . . . i've been blessed with a terrible memory, this list is in no way comprehensive.  music depends on the mood. lately i've been buried in a lot of electro/house/trance, occasionally going back to rock, metal, ska, punk, classical, jazz, big band and swing. current go-to's have been edm heavy: nero, deadmau5, gareth emery (podcast), zedd, porter robinson, feed me, and whomever i happen to have discovered this week that would fit into the next set i spin.  food, everything any anything new. love sushi, will try making anything strange or ridiculous (which sometimes turns out disasterous), steak, burgers, pizza, pasta, bbq anything, grilled anything, fresh veggies, squashies. i'm the co-inventor for the world's most delicious breakfast, which i coined \"lovers in bed\". not vegan/vegetarian though, though i was there once. i do my best to eat local, eat fresh, stay organic (not religiously, but it seems like a good start!) i've recently discovered couscous, tumeric, fresh parsley, heirloom tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and again, all the wonderful squashies at the farmer's markets! friends, edm, food, a job, masturbation, a journal listening. constantly trying to figure things out or understand people and situations. sex. what motivates people. asking myself, \"what do i want?\" wondering where i could be had i made any other life decisions. . . out having a beer, at a show, playing music, relaxing, out for a walk, reading, dreaming about going in for a massage, stuff can be moody as hell. when drunk enough, i have a tendency to pick up unfinished drinks at friend's parties. . . and finish them. you feel like it. woowoo!  you want to discuss internet addictions, or savagely peruse e-mail, fb, this site whenever you get your hands on a computer. resist. . .  you do/are any of the following: ski/snowboard, go dancing, disc golf, have a strange and intense passion, love to go for walks/strolls/hikes, play cello or violin (or any instrument), have/want a pet, were born in the 80's, know who michael foucault is, know something i don't, don't know something i do, analyze the hell out of people, situations, and experiences, take showers (or baths), or abuse punctuation brutally under most typing conditions. . .\n",

      "i'm full of energy, spastic, ambitious and a lot of fun to be around (so i'm told...). i have a very blunt/dirty sense of humor and love it! but even with the extremities of my humor, i am respectful towards other people and i do actively practice manors in between curse words. i like photography, video games, the outdoors (anything from a day hike to a week out in the wilderness), and i have a passion for my career in the maritime industry. i am constantly busy and am always looking for an excuse to do something fun! i am graduating from the california maritime academy this summer, and will eventually seek a job as a tug boat captain. later after i pay off my loans, i would like to go back to school and get a master's degree in naval architecture.  i also like to volunteer with the sea scots (yes it is a youth program that does exist lol) my last project for the sea scouts was writing a first aid quiz and also writing/coordinating/planning live action first aid scenarios for a large regatta on the u.s.s. hornet on memorial day weekend :d it was a total blast i must say. celestial navigation, carpentry, having fun, being there for others/friends/family, photography, digital editing, killing zombies, cooking, creative writing, beer, slinkys, (not to sound arrogant, but everyone loves these things. this should be a selling point for you lol) listening to others, dogs, attending class, not attending class (i like to think of myself as multifunctional), making jokes about being a bad student, punching out teachers, cuddling, blowing minds, realizing that i actually disappoint minds, drawing at a third grade level, coloring at a second grade level, the outdoors, the indoors, the sidedoors, the backdoors... okay, that was over the line and i am sorry. sarcasm. usually people see the random/funny/crazy side of me. they might also think that i'm a little crazy. after a while they will see a totally normal side.... then i'll make a poop joke. it happens.  i'm also told that i have nice eyes and a flat butt... while i respectfully disagree with the lack of butticular contour, hopefully my eyes distract people from what may or may not be there... books: the five people you meet in heaven, harry potter, and the holy bowditch (in his faith, we navigate).  movies: no favorites... but i like scifi, action, cartoons, fantasy, disney, and stupid college movies! i also enjoy horror, thriller, and romance if it's done right.  shows: south park, family guy, adventure time!, archer, almost anything on discovery channel, sponge bob, fairly odd parents, the office, firefly, andromeda, doll house, spartacus.  music: alternative, pop, rock, r&b, rap, some country, techno, club music, oldies, jazz, classical.  food: ......i like food. food, water, shelter, internet, cell phone, fresh undies... cuz that shit's important. my future, my goals, my life (past and present), what i care about, who i care about, having fun!, life in general, philosophy, work.  i spend most of my thinking minutes on my future, i think. i've lived in the bay area for 22 years now and i feel like i'm starting to out grow it. i can't do anything about it for a little while, but eventually, when i get i better job after school is done, i've been thinking about moving somewhere new. san diego is currently at the top of my list but i'm still unsure. usually working or studding... gross, i know. i'm always up for an excuse to do something else on a friday night though.  lately i've been trying to hit the bars a little more. sometimes i'm down for karaoke. i can bust out some jams, let me tell you what. but if i'm not doing any of that then i'm home watching a movie or a new show :) i used to have this say \"im an open book, you can ask me anything!\" but then i realized how tasteless that sounded. i mean, it's not like anyone is going to run off with one of your most privet secrets or anything, right?

      "i'm an artist; an intellectual; a woman; world willing one day a wife, mother, and matriarch; i'm a lover, not a fighter  conflict and anger avoidant, at times to a fault; i'm a car fanatic to the core; i know my potential  i know what i can do with what i've been given, and mark my words i am going to do it; i'm terrified of being a failure or disappointment  to me, to my said potential. but that's not deep enough. i can list until i'm blue in the face, but if you don't understand the convictions behind it all, what good is any of it? i'll start with art. art is the expression of the innermost emotions or convictions (be it traditionally, musically, etc.); reality is a common convergence of perspectives; art influences where these convergences can, do, and will occur. i cannot possibly express my love for, my empathy for, my visceral connection with, my emotional and psychological dependence on, art. in my darkest times art saved me. if i have one goal in life, it is to ensure my continued and furthered experiencing of art. no matter where my life takes me, no matter what comes my way, i will forever surround myself with and immerse myself in art. although there isn't much to say, nature, i feel, should be my next point. i feel at home when in nature. i feel clear. i feel grounded. i feel at peace. i feel overwhelmed and overjoyed by its sheer beauty. more important than how i feel about nature, though, is how other people in this society don't, and how it bothers and confuses me. i don't understand why we allow oil companies to have so much control over our legislature, or over how we treat our environment. i don't understand how we can ignore and destroy such beauty. i feel like there's this relatively unspoken battle with money, greed, and arrogance on one side, and with nature, art, and intelligence on the other. it goes without saying i side with the latter, but allow me to explain why. money, greed, arrogance, anger  they're all concepts that i understand on a logical and intellectual level yet severely lack empathy for. i don't understand how one could think it's okay to destroy part of nature, something that is most certainly not his to destroy, for personal or financial gain. also, i don't understand how something that won't matter in a year, let alone a month, or week, or day, or hour even, can make people so angry. there's so much cruelty and suffering in this world  why allow something that won't matter to elicit such unnecessary negativity and unrest? how do so many people have such a monumental, gargantuan, and obliterating lack of perspective? why are people always so angry? it genuinely confuses and concerns me. money, materialism, consumerism, they all go hand in hand with greed, which as i said, is something i truly lack. the closest connection to any of those i have is my desire to completely spoil rotten the ones i love, but even that stems from the purity of wanting to be nothing but my best for the ones i love, and the pure bliss i get from their excitement, enjoyment, and happiness. i feel like this society we live in has become the collective group of people chained in plato's cave. we see the shadows on the wall, not understanding the true value or meaning behind them. these shadows are material possessions, and our society has far surpassed an unhealthy obsession. the fire behind them that projects these shadows is freedom. we've created a world where we can't just live  we must fight. this isn't some ancient native village where one is free to experience what the world has to offer in harmony with and respect for one's surroundings. we are forced by this faade of structure called government to go to school, graduate, choose either a white or blue collar, and fight an either frivolously intellectual or stupidly mundane battle, the prize of which being material possession. we have seriously lost our way. material possession is not the goal; it is the byproduct of freedom. the more money one has, the less one must fight, and the closer to freedom one becomes. i feel this is why our society has become so obsessed with celebrity culture, because let's face it; they have it all. they are what our society considers to be physically attractive, they have such insane amounts of money that they live in complete freedom, able to indulge and experience whatever impulses come their way. it can be argued that in this society, that is our nirvana  freedom from the system. however, our society has lost sight of this, focusing rather on the material possessions that come with such financial wealth. the goal should be, rather my goal is, to simply live in harmony. in taking part in something i enjoy, i will to make enough money to cover my expenses, whatever those may be.  enfp - the champion - http://www.okcupid.com/quizzy/results?quizzyid=16567335035599898597&userid=7725723449748750346 living. loving. learning. recently my artistic passions have shiftted from print media to performance, mainly in the form of tribal fusion, burlesque, and pole (facebook.com/fionalnoir). racing is also on the back-burner if i can ever save up enough money to put myself through school (total gearhead...). also, pin-up is a huge part of my life, and i'm considering modeling or getting back behind the camera.  as for work i'm a street fundraiser and loving it. wouldn't you like to know ;)  ...... i feel like i really shouldn't be answering these @ 3am deliriously tired hmmm... my hair?

      "i grew up in the east bay, but i recently moved from seattle, wa where i was getting my master's degree. i got my undergraduate degrees in drama and geography. i like to go out and do things, but i also enjoy a relaxing night at home. i have two dogs, so i would like to meet people who like pets and don't have allergies. i tend to be a night person, but i would like to meet people who won't make my staying up late habits worse, but who don't have a circadian rhythms entirely opposite mine. a love learning and travel, and a similar sense of humor are also important. oh yes, and i love sharing food so i get to try as many things as possible. i love dancing (latin, ballroom, tap, ballet, or just moving awkwardly to music). i also enjoy skiing (both water and snow) and camping. i also love board games and trivia. i have a bike which i rarely use, but for the last year, i have had great plans to ride it somewhere other than to my local library. politically i'm liberal, so if you are a republican or don't vote we probably won't get along. the same goes for if shopping at walmart is important to you. i'm not into watching sports, so if that's your thing, cool, but i'm not going to join you (with some exceptions during the olympics). fyi--i would like to have one or two kids at some point. should we happen to meet, fall in love, and all that jazz, make sure you propose with an ethical diamond or some other stone, if you don't know what i'm talking about, check out the movie blood diamonds before you propose to anyone. i am in the process of becoming an occupational therapist. if you don't know what that is, don't feel bad, you are not alone. i'll just say it is similar to physical therapy and should we meet, i'd be happy to explain the differences. putting my foot in my mouth (figuratively--although i can do it literally too). i don't know, you tell me? my inner beauty? books-i always say my favorite book is \"to kill a mockingbird\" but there are so many good ones. i like mysteries and mostly i read fiction. although for school/work i have been reading a lot of bio's about people with disabilities. i also said in the fourth grade i was going to read every newberry award winner, and i am still in the process. the newberry award is given by librarians for children's literature. so i also still read chapter books as my students used to call them. i've also probably read the majority of fiction/bio books on iran. i like sedaris (both david and amy), steinbeck, and vonnegut. movies-i love movies, i rarely hate one. just off the top of my head, wizard of oz, the italian job, shawshenk redemtion, edward scissorhands, zoolander, glory, roman holiday, there's too many, i can't think of a comprehensive list. i like comedies, dramas, horror, action, etc. music-i love showtunes. but i also like pretty much a little of everything else. i used to say i didn't like country till i opened my mind to it, and now i even like some of that. i will not choose whether the beatles or the rolling stones are better, i like them both. okay, fine i pick beatles. food-i love almost everything with the exception of kidneys. if you've never had them, i don't recommend them. i say thai is my favorite kind of food, but really variety is the spice of life. so mexican, italian, chinese, persian, indian, etc. i do have to watch my weight due to my love of food and drink. i would consider becoming a vegetarian, but never a vegan. my pets. my family. sleep. food. books. movies. how come when i answer more questions it never changes my percentage compatibility with people? am i wasting time on this okcupid thing? it's starting to feel like it. going out or staying at home. i can't think of anything. does that mean i'm boring? who's up for a game of truth or dare? you feel like it.\n",

      "i'm currently working full to part time for an upscale/ fine dining restaurant, putting together a country band( old style country with rockabilly / punk influences) and volunteering to aid the recovery of other alcoholics.  over the last couple of months i've found that my personality is changing a lot and so is my taste in the opposite sex. so i've decided to put off the idea of getting into a monogamous relationship, because i can't give up sex and i don't really know what i want in a partner.  i feel like some people really can't understand that me not wanting to see them exclusively has nothing to do with their worth as a sexual partner and that i don't want to just treat women like pieces of meat to used. it's hard to be honest too, which i really don't have to be, but i feel like my partners deserve to know. right now i'm starting to get into yoga. i feel kinda weird to say it but i'm really stoked on it. then as always i'm trying to get a band together and start playing live music. i'm really good at loafing around on the couch for a couple of days, then getting anxious because i haven't done anything for days then running around like a crack head trying to do a bunch of stuff to make up it. the first thing people notice about me is how tall i am. then they slowly realize that i'm a total looooooon. i love music. all kinds of music. i like to play it, listen to it, and dance to it. i like it because it brings people together and uplifts the spirt. the bands i'm into most right now are; the vandals, the dwarves, stanley brothers, off!, black flag, lee perry, queen, david bowie, fear, subhumanz, la plebe, david allen coe, johnny cash, hank williams sr. and 3, the good, the bad, and the leftovercrack, creedence clearwater revival, the misfits, devil makes three, and old crow medicine show, mississippi john hurt, blackbird raum, george jones, tom waits, cris smither.  books; lonely werewolf girl, diamond age, neverwhere, hardcore zen, sirens of titan, dune!, choke, fight club, welcome to the monkey house.  i don't really watch t.v. at all any more but i'm really into b class horror films and cult classics. i could never do without my guitar, cigarettes, the weekly article by dan savage in the sfweekly, youtube, burritos, and pizza. the crack head sitting next to the buisness man across from me on the bus and how long it's going to take that buisness man to realize he's about to get drooled on. i'm usually at the cafe international playing country. i don't know what the fuck is going on. you should message me if you're not a crack head and with in the reach of a bart train.\n",
      "i wake up every morning grateful that i get paid to do what i love for a living. i am an expressive arts therapist and each new day presents me with a fresh story, a new adventure and new ways of deepening my connection to another human being. i am humbled by this profession. so what am i doing when i'm off the clock? i enjoy a myriad of activities. taking a long stroll throughout the city to admire and appreciate the textured urban landscape of san francisco usually tickles my fancy. i also enjoy a bit more ambitious adventures like long walks across the golden gate bridge for a bay view lunch in sausalito before heading back to san francisco via ferry boat, or driving down hwy 1 for a weekend camping excursion somewhere near big sur where the redwoods, the ocean and the river are evenly spaced out but accessible. i also enjoy the typical city standards; live music, theater, dance, creative expression, seeing movies, dining out, game night, or just having friends over for dinner, wine and intelligent conversation. i work out regularly, eat healthy, live mindfully and have a deep commitment to a meditation practice and self care.  if adam sandler is your favorite actor, chances are we probably won't get a long too well. don't take this the wrong way, but i just find him to be un-funny. i've given him plenty of chances. i have. i guess the man i'm looking for is a cross between a outdoor adventure enthusiast, and a mindful and self reflective couch potato who has some talent and skill in the kitchen. he won't be too aggravated if i wake him up at sunrise on a saturday morning to catch a quiet cable car ride downtown for a coffee on union square followed by brunch. he can appreciate the muffled sound in tahoe after a hearty snow fall on a crisp winter morning. he has a wild sense of humor, compassion for himself & for those who suffer. he is intelligent, values sensuality, can dance, sing, be goofy and most importantly, wants to be in a relationship. points if you wear glasses, have a meditation practice and cook. hmm...climbing the same mountain you are, just on a different trail up? i'm living my life, that's what i'm doing with it...with all it's joys and sorrows, it's celebrations and grievings, and everything in between. kissing. laughing, not taking life too seriously, enjoying the outdoors, following directions, rebelling, eating healthy, having fun, keeping my life organized, cooking, memorizing song lyrics, my job. i look unusually young for my age. music: ryan adams, whiskeytown, bell x1, the beatles, csn&y, neil young, hall and oates, my morning jacket, amy winehouse, fleetwood mac, tom petty, david byrne, really, the list goes on. music is very important and if we ever meet in person, i'm certain it would be a topic of discussion.  books: recently been studying and training in mindfulness meditation so i've been reading a lot of jon kabat-zinn. since i love what i do for a living, i typically like to read books that further enhance my work. we can get into that later.  movies: i love intense dramas and psychological thrillers, movies that make me think. i also love mindless comedies and mainstream blockbusters too. some favorites include, american beauty, vicki christina barcelona, almost famous, the changeling, take shelter. the freedom to just be me asking questions sensuality paying attention losing myself through music, dance, sex, art, or any other creative/expressive outlet big trees, oceans, rolling hills, urban texture, flowing rivers, still lakes, choppy oceans, the smell of lilacs (this is all just a romantic way to say nature) human relationships, interconnection, how to be more mindful, lyrics to music and how they apply to my life. cooking and creating compatible flavors, music, impermanence, people, creativity and it's many forms, the human condition, ryan adams, vacations, kissing. out to a nice dinner and drinks with friends...maybe hit up a show. recently started an amateur band with some friends (which usually turns into a wine, dinner, jam session) but it \"typically\" takes place on friday nights. i keep it mostly mellow, but i'm not opposed to a rager ever once in awhile. i'm turned on by a man in glasses. you don't take these profiles too seriously but instead you are willing to just meet up, have an honest, no pressure cup of coffee or glass of wine...with good intentions.\n",

      "december 2011: i seem to have gotten involved with somebody in real life, so i'm really, really not looking to date now.  as of august 2011, i'm taking a break. (i'll come on the site and do quizzes and such, but i've got way too much going on at this time - heavy-duty at work, multiple friends with major medical problems, etc - to really be very available, even though i'm still technically single.)  i'm a liberal-arts geek boy. i don't take myself altogether seriously.  i enjoy tradition-based dancing (english country dance, contra, cajun, waltzing), reading (trash and serious stuff), writing (mostly on computer topics), live music, movies (smart and dumb; not scared by subtitles), theatre, comedy shows, talking, listening. i do computers and english country dance but don't have to talk about them.  i pay attention to politics and sometimes despair about it.  i'm smart, funny (both witty and goofy), and generally kind. i spell well. i'm a fairly good listener (although i can't always stop myself from \"working the problem\", i do recognize that it's not always the only thing to do.)  i use too many parentheses. i am whimsical, sensual, and kind.  i am indoorsy - appreciate natural beauty and don't mind a nice walk, but if you're looking for a rock-climbing buddy or someone to camp in the woods with, i'm not your guy. i'm not weak, and i have a lot of endurance - i can contra-dance for hours, which is pretty aerobic - but wear down quickly when it's hot. so i am *never* going to burning man, but i have friends who do and love it, and that's okay.  i enjoy makerfaire and steampunk stuff vicariously, but my complete unhandiness - i can usually sew on buttons without hurting myself very badly, but had many traumatic childhood experiences with model kits and soldering - make me uninterested in participating. i also have a lot of trouble with pictogram directions and need clear words.  i don't mind people looking at me funny - years of morris dancing, more years of stopping for gas on the way to the historical dance, so pumping gas in my tailcoat - but i'm not particularly into doing stuff just to freak people out or just to show off. dancing promoting community through dance - through service on nonprofit boards, bringing community dance to new audiences, etc. trying to be a good friend without prioritizing my own needs so low that they don't get met. looking for joy. waltzing. community dance. teaching community dance (english country dance, regency, victorian, ceilidh, moving into contra.)  facilitating discussions (on mailing lists and in person).  kissing/flirting/making out.  listening, talking, writing, reading.  vms system administration and webmastering. explaining technical things to non-technical people.  spelling, grammar (can't diagram a sentence to save my life, but my ear is very good), and vocabulary.  i can be pretty clever and funny, but it doesn't always come when i want it. if i'm dancing, that i'm radiating joy (or that i'm wearing a loud shirt, or that i'm sweating profusely).  if i'm not dancing, then it might be my smile, or the white streak in my dark-brown curly hair. my favorite music: cole porter, bare necessities, austin lounge lizards, various rockabilly/swing/blues/cajun, lots of country dance stuff, everly brothers, contra dance bands, waltzes, show tunes. don't keep up with currently-popular music. i like witty songs with rhymes; not that big on screaming and thrashing around.  my favorite books: i kinda like the one i wrote (about webservers on the vms operating system), but my book consumption has gone way down in the last couple of years as i rarely seem to have time. i'm getting through \"the new yorker\" most weeks. leisure reading is usually mysteries, occasionally sf or fantasy, often history/biography and sometimes humor. (just read alan morehead's \"the white nile\"; thought it good.) but i haven't been delving back through my comfort reading the way i used to.  movies: the blues brothers, airplane, monty python and the holy grail, singin' in the rain (still), annie hall, north by northwest, castle cagliostro, bringing up baby. there's been some pretty high-quality tripe out lately, and i really liked the first two spiderman and first two x-men movies, ray, walk the line, shaun of the dead, and the three lotr movies. i thought good night and good luck was very solid work.  tv: daily show, colbert report, house, dr. who sometimes, firefly, buffy, ds9, maverick, occasional mythbusters binges.  food: i have a really low capsicum tolerance, and don't like stuff that burns my tongue. i always order the peanut sauce prawns at my nearby thai restaurant. mmm, peanut sauce. the split-pea soup at the fog city diner was pretty darned good the last time i was there. i like pasta a lot but can't eat too much starch at a time. asian food is okay but i don't want to eat it for every meal. dancing/music  friends  kissing/making out  good-natured intellectual argument  whimsy  reading matter. how to get myself in to work before noon.  how to be a better dance leader/teacher.  why i can't seem to share most majority interests, except for movies.  why so many people fall for obvious spin, and how to rescue the country from the spinners. dancing and/or calling a dance or seeing a play or seeing a band like wake the dead or the bobs or the austin lounge lizards in a small venue or sometimes traveling or sometimes at home doing laundry or at work finishing a project. [i'm adding several 'private' things here, all of which seem like good things for potential girlfriends to know.]  my semi-adopted sister lives with me, in my egregiously cluttered and dusty house. i'm a bad homeowner - completely unhandy. we hang out sometimes, not romantically; if that's not okay, it's probably better not to mess with me.  i have a decent job and i'm very stable - more than 25 years at the same place - but i'm not great with money and i don't feel well-to-do.  i tend to be oriented toward doing stuff for others rather more than for myself.  as of march 2011, i'm truly single - not seeing anybody at all - for the first time in 20 years. i'm in no hurry to dive into a marriage-track relationship. i'm not looking to just tomcat around, and i'm certainly open to eventual monogamous committed relationship, but i don't want to live in your pocket or have you in mine.  when the chemistry is there, i'm an enthusiastic, passionate and (i'm told) skilled lover, but pretty vanilla. i don't rule out kink, but it's not going to come spontaneously from me.  despite oktrends saying everybody lies about their height and age, i'm telling the truth here. i really was born in late 1959, and i really am about 5'9 and 3/4, 5'10 in shoes.  for some reason, many of my high match percentages are with bisexual women half my age who are only looking for women. what's up with that? ... you want to meet me (duh), or have questions about country dancing, or regency stuff in the bay area, or want to hire me to lead community dance for some function of yours.  if you'd like to do some indoorsy activities (movies, dinner, theater) and see how we get along.  if you don't need me to fit into your life plan.\n",
      "oh, that's easy: i'd say the happiest, smartest, sweetest, hottest, cutest... well, the most perfect girl on earth!  and i almost forgot: i'm funny and i'm on a good mood 95% of the time. because life is great! (and i use a lot of exclamation points)  i'm from salvador - bahia, a beautiful place in brazil, but hey - don't ask me if i can samba, the size of my a(bleep) or if i speak spanish. i do speak spanish, but in my country we all speak portuguese. please remember that. about my assets, hum... look into my eyes (bryan adam's song playing now) first. see? i am also a romantic.  arrived in the us about 2 years ago because the company i work for transferred me here - i'm loving it! made great friends as soon as i arrived, but most of them has left. i feel that people here are very nice but it's difficult to make strong connections.  i'm a world traveler and kind of a 'gipsy'. have lived in the east coast (prior to this time) as an exchange student/au pair, in london and in grenoble, france, where i concluded my master degree. traveling and get to know other cultures are really my passion.  i like to take care of myself and be in a good shape, that's why i work out pretty much everyday. i noticed that sf is a city-bike, so i bought a road bike and even already got injured for falling down on the cable car track: a classic! i wish i was a singer or writer... but i followed the business path and made my parents proud. i work with the internetz; those ones from the silicon valley. for a woman from a 3rd world country (in development now), be where i am now is really grateful. i got everything with a lot of effort, hard work, dedication and support from my family, who saved every penny to provide me a good education. education is the key. i love to learn. i love to cheer people up: life is much easier when everyone is happy! and i try to always be nice to anyone. it might sound a bit cliche, but when you're nice to people, the universe returns it back and people are nice to you. it's true: try it :)  because i can adapt myself very well to different situations, i'm good at connecting to any kind of people. i have so many diverse friends, from a variety of backgrounds: from wish-to-be a super model to phd researchers (none is better than other, just part of different worlds). everyone has something interesting to share. it fascinates me. my beautiful long caramel curly hair result of this thing called miscegenation! sometimes people think it's not real, but i assure it's all real natural mine and i love the way it is! (not too long now)  and my big black hipster glasses. i love jazz, funk, blues, indie rock, bossa nova, brazilian popular songs... very eclectic: nina simone, the beatles, gilberto gil, ray charles, arcade fire, al green, the smiths, foster the people, beirut! i don't enjoy heavy metal songs and to be honest i'm not a big fan of hip hop (but i know how to do the stanky legg - ha!) and i do like good rap.  movies: i cried watching hotel rwanda, laughed with midnight in paris and enjoyed many times ethernal sunshine of the spotless mind. and if you haven't, please watch city of god, it's impressive.  food: i like to eat right and to avoid all the bad stuff as much as i can. i love seafood, fish, vegetables, cheeses (with a great glass of cava or champagne). i love going to restaurants and i can try any kind of food. but restaurants chains and fast food: no, thanks!  i read a lot online lately, which is kinda sad. best things in life are free: love, family, friendship, hugs, the sun, the ocean, the beautiful sky... could't live without these. but i need few things that money can buy: my glasses or contacts, i need to see where i'm step on it! internet connection, to get in contact with amazing people, like my family who lives miles away. my passport, because the world is big and we never know what is next my bike, which has been my best friend in this town exercising, anything that make me feel good and sexy: biking, running, pilates, yoga and free good mood & sense of humor: with so many problems in the world, i have no excuse to be sad. of course i get sad (who doesn't?) but then i try to remember how fortunate i am. yes, i laugh! if the plants in my deck are dead since i keep forgetting to water them. damn it. having dinner with few friends that i made here, cooking and trying a new wine. dancing! and sometimes at home by myself, reading on my computer or listening to music... and there is nothing wrong with it! it's not the most private thing, but i've never done drugs. it's just not my thing. ok, i smoked a cigarette when was a kid and hate it. then smoked pot once when 17. that's it. plus, i don't drink a lot. you think i'm boring, huh? you're so wrong! you love life and are very happy. you respect people and the diversity of this world. like me, you still believe in this humanity (we are dreamers!) you take care of yourself and are active, are a gentleman and intelligent. you're sensitive and have a big heart. big plus if you are tall. and please make me laugh. that's not too much, right? that's ok: i can make you laugh :)  i hope you have figured out your carrer path and are always trying to develop yourself to succeed. but please i don't need to hear about your possessions around here.  i would like to get to know you better before meet. i've been to many okc dates before, been in relationships (and learned a lot with them) - but now, when not with friends or dancing, i'd rather spend time in my house - drinking a good wine, listening to good music or watching a good movie - than going to lots of dates. i'm looking for a partner in crime and do look for a long term relationship, but am not in a rush.\n",
      "about me.. i spend my days working downtown, keeping my fitness up, and cooking when i have time. i take hikes, snowboard trips, faraway vacations frequently to keep my sanity. i have lived in dc and sf for most of my life. i work in energy finance. kicking butt at my job is a high priority, but i still make plenty of time to indulge in friends/family, music, boxing, art, outdoors, poker, cooking, traveling. i decided as a goal to compete in a triathlon this year. keeping life in balance is important to me, so i spontaneously take adventures. i am good at staying active, joking, being spontaneous. i am decisive and don't regret my choices. people say i am fun to be around. my blue eyes. they make me easy to talk to..until i say something too honest movies: the 25th hour (book also amazing). rounders. no country for old men (book good). 12 angry men. v for vendetta. american psycho. inception. memento. zoolander.  music: i have a million pandora stations.  shows: the wire. game of thrones. mad men. breaking bad. curb.  books: i like nonfiction  food: italian cooking is my favorite especially from the islands i.e. sicilian/sardinian. i was not given a sweet tooth to enjoy all the desserts out there. 1. people i love 2. headphones 3. snowboarding 4. 49ers 5. fresh food 6. salsa - my personal goals - traveling - i keep \"live as if you were to die tomorrow. learn as if you were to live forever\" (gandhi) in the back of my mind - why does the \"most interesting man in the world\" drink a second rate beer? - relief that i don't live in a time when left handed people are burnt at the stake out with friends, working late or leaving town i love shakira. you would like to get to know me better!\n",
      "in a nutshell: i'm spontaneous, i love going on adventures far and near, and am always up for trying new things (skydiving, ok lets go! cooking classes to learn how to make sushi? yes please) i try to have fun no matter what i'm doing, it's not hard, just surround yourself with great people, and the outcome will be a big smile on your face.  now, instead of me writing a short story about myself, just message me if you are at all intrigued. i think the more important question is what i am not doing with my life? to start, lots. i'm not superman, i can't do everything, but what i can do is make the most of it, and doing that with someone awesome would be even better than doing it alone.  i'd love to do more for my community, i'd also like to do more for kids, maybe teach a few how to ride a bike, or play basketball.  but for now, i spend my mornings in the gym, my days at a startup, working with great people as we try to change the world. singing in the shower, making popcorn, solving problems, having fun (seriously, some people are just good at this, are you?), building sandcastles, listening, and adapting. people tell me i have nice hair, usually i say thank you. i like books, but i read them on my ipad or kindle because i also really like trees. bridges of madison county, three cups of tea, and outliers are a few i've read recently.  i have a pretty eclectic taste in music, but if i had to pick a few genre's i listen to the most, i'd have to say rock/alt, hip hop/r&b, and electronic/house/dance, oh and jazz.  as for food, i love trying new things, and there isn't much i don't like, try me ;) family/friends adventure music communication the ability to smile what else i can do to make a difference in the world while i am not thinking about where i should go on vacation next. i'll know when friday comes, or suggest something ;) jajaja, yo no se lo digas a secretos en internet you like ice cream, or you think can teach me something new :)\n",
      "i believe that you can have fun doing almost anything, it just depends on the company involved. one of my favorite quotes is by john lennon \"life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans\"  that philosophy has led me to a very happy open relationship with the ever wonderful fnordloki. we recently moved from a \"same room only\" open relationship to full polyamory which has been going wonderfully!  i like old fashioned things. letters that smell like the person that wrote them with little doodles around the edge, men who wear fedoras, dress shirts, and suit pants. i suppose i miss the romantic bits from a bygone era when men pulled chairs, and drank whiskey in their smoking jacket by the fire. when women wore line back stockings and dresses like flowers. when your friday nights were spent ballroom dancing to a live band. simply put i enjoy the company of dandies.  i also love eccentricities in a person. people that appreciate and enjoy creating surprise in everyday life, people that can find the magic in the mundane, and people that want to spend an afternoon daydreaming about the fascinations of the universe with me. trying to learn how to do everything i possibly can! i tend to make things, and learning how to make something new, or do it in a different way helps me become unlimited in what i can create. i know everything from gardening to welding... but there is always room to learn more or to expand my existing knowledge.  professionally i spent many years as a industrial seamstress, and then as a preschool teacher specializing in natural sciences and developmental art, then a seamstress again, but this time sewing fabric based props. often on the side i will take commission work for custom period piece garments and work on my comics.  i am also starting to gather extraordinary people around me. people that are interested in taking this lifetime and doing everything they can with it! part of why i am on here is to possibly meet new people that i wouldn't have met otherwise. costuming in general especially sewing victorian ballgowns, corsets, and vintage clothing. staying up late drawing, painting, or working on some crazy art project that absolutely needed doing. i am fairly good at ballroom dancing, but haven't been going as often as i used to so i'm a bit rusty. exploring tide pools, nature, or hiking around climbing on craggy rocks. cooking. tasting a dish at a restaurant then going home and figuring out how it's made. i've been told i'm very distinctive and that i tend to stand out.. that could just be a polite way of saying \"i wasn't staring at your huge breasts\" but you never know. i also have rather long bright red hair which is the second thing they see.  what people notice when they get to know me is my sense of humor and my directness. no complaints so far. also people say they notice my laugh.. probably because it's loud. i read a lot. i will almost always have a book in my purse. some of my favorite authors are ray bradbury, niel gaiman, kurt vonnegut, hunter s. thompson, david sedaris, the brothers grimm, and christopher moore. i love mythology and folk tails of all kinds, though i have a secret love of norse mythology. i also love graphic novel collections: sandman, watchmen, transmetropolitan, black hole, maus, anything r. crumb, etc. i love comics and feel they are an under-appreciated art form. maybe i'm biased because i draw comics myself.  i love movies. i love old horror movies, science fiction, foreign films and shorts, quality japanese animation like howl's moving castle (and really anything studio ghibli), but every once in a while i love watching goofy movies like zoolander. i don't know if i could say what my favorite movies are, hard to pick only a few but here goes: brazil, harold and maude, young frankenstein, the muppet movie, spirited away (actually all of miyazaki's works), amelie, the king of hearts, fear and loathing in las vegas, all the batman movies that weren't dumb (you know what you did shumacher!), almost anything tim burton, metropolis, akira kurosawa's \"dreams\", blue velvet, umm.. the list will just keep going like this. as far as television is concerned i love doctor who and the mighty boosh, also firefly, and the rest of joss whedon's work.  i like music... mainly old lady music from the times of big bands, crooners, and jazz that meant something, cab calloway, doris day, josephine baker, nina simone, henri mancini, billy holiday cole porter, les baxter, etc. but of course i like more modern music as well... i just tend to like most music really, not so into rap, and i despise pop country and boy bands.. some bands: david bowie, the pixies, harry nilson, cat stevens, iron and wine, nick cave, love, frank zappa, tom waits, leonard cohen, the talking heads, of montreal, beirut, the flaming lips, goldfrap, arcade fire, etc.  i don't know what i would say is my favorite food because i just tend to like food, and making it. among the common themes of food lately would be sushi, burritos, thai noodles, korean tofu hot pot, and tikka masala. my hands, my eyes, my ears, my mouth, my feet, and my skin.  being a smart-ass aside: fnordloki, my sewing machine, music to dance to, creative outlets, laughter, and nature. fnordloki ... stuff to make.. the art project i am working on at that moment.. hypothetical situations like if zombies attacked right now what would i do? i don't think i have a usual friday night, it's always different.. it depends heavily on who i am hanging out with that night.. i may be out at a costume party, a dance, sewing, getting tiki drinks, playing boardgames, exploring the bay area, or just watching old movies. i think that confessing that i'm bi and have an open bedroom policy with fnordloki is pretty damned private.. hmm... i sing a lot when i'm alone... and i like riddles. -if you are an eccentric, funny, intelligent, crafty, clever, person who is interested in a friends first maybe something later approach to dating.  -if you spend a great deal of time expanding your horizons in one way or another, love dressing up in crazy costumes, consider yourself a true gentleman/dandy, and don't plan on mentioning my breasts in your first few opening lines of chat text (seriously guys have some tact).  i would also recommend you look at my partner fnordloki profile if you want perspective. i am looking for extraordinary people to start doing extraordinary things with!  warning: if you revel in being poorly educated apply elsewhere. if you send me a message that is anything like, \"u r hot, i have big penis\" or \"nice rack\" or \"i like to f**k, how bout u\" (real messages i have gotten by the way) i will abruptly tell the computer never to let you contact me again as well as send my team of ninja assassins after you. also telling me how good you are at oral in your first message will not have the desired effect.\n",
      "i love television, cookie dough, swimming in the ocean. obsessed with my ewok dog. favorite cocktail = diet coke. grad student in spanish lit. tease me about it at your own risk :) eating? getting lost? my dog. totally upstaged by my dog. a suitable boy (read it!!); my family and other animals; anna karenina; middlemarch; candide; the persian boy the 1st half of lawrence of arabia and the 2nd half of doctor zhivago; shadows in the palace; tea with mussolini artichokes! friends, music, sex, airplanes, flip flops, beyonce what is in my refrigerator and what i am going to do with it maybe dancing. or whatever. if nothing satisfying is going on i'd rather be home with my space heater. i'm really, really afraid of anything with tentacles. when \"paul the octopus\" came on tv i screamed like a girl and ran out of the room. you are a big strong man who can sweep me off my feet\n",
      "born in southern california, i've lived up and down the west coast of america. i had a tumultuous adolescence and young adult life due to an upbringing in a sort of religious cult. don't worry, years of therapy has drained my wallet and made me somewhat normal. my sense of humor is quite dark; i love a joke with good shock value. dancing is something i need to do on a regular basis either at a club or in studio (or in my hallway/kitchen/bedroom.) if i'm not dancing i'm probably rock climbing, a second passion of mine. i love arranging things: clothes on my body, items in my home, numbers in my checkbook, if it's inanimate i probably want to control it. i live in the mission with two good friends and have been a hair stylist for about ten years. right now i'm working hard to build my business. i'm quite busy at the salon and currently taking pictures of my work to put on my website, daviddoesmyhair.com. i'm learning spanish and working through a book called the artists way which requires a lot of journaling. i spend a vast amount of time reflecting, getting to know what makes me tick so i can share that knowledge with a partner. i'm also encouraging myself to find and engage in activities that truly fulfill me. (i'm discovering that staring at pictures of hot men on this website may not be truly fulfilling, damn it.) when i put my mind to it, i am very good at being an active listener (when i dont put my mind to it i'm busy thinking about myself.) i'm handy around the house. (i actually own power tools.) i'm most proud of being able to make people feel comfortable which comes in very handy in my line of work. (i also think i'm good at using parenthesis which probably is all in my head.) well recently people have been telling me i look like adam levine. i'll take that compliment! besides that, i do get comments about my eyes. so let's say eyes. eyes is my final answer. books: buddha's brain, the commitment, astrology for the soul, emotional intelligence, a general theory of love, morning in the burned house, passionate marriage, benitas book, the bible (just kidding, i hate fiction) ...  movies: billy elliot, clue, i am love, drop dead gorgeous, pina, what the @$#% do we know? death becomes her, return to oz, up, paris is burning, hamlet 2, the game... and there is so much more...  music: the knife! fever ray, yeasayer, little dragon, hot chip, gossip, portishead, nina simone, fiona apple, mj, hall and oates, lykke li, bon iver, bjork, crystal castles, friendly fires, tune-yards, pj harvey, yeah yeah yeahs, arcade fire, the national.....i could go on and on and on....house music is always great too!  food: i can't eat dairy or gluten, so anything else that's left i will eat. i enjoy sushi, mexican food (i'm going to turn into a taco soon), home cooked dinners with friends. a cushy mattress music love sex internet access betty crockers gluten free bownie mix i spend a lot of time thinking about my intentions. i also spend a lot of time thinking about men. well it's friday night and i'm filling out this survey which is merely an illustration of my versatility. i have also been known to go dancing, watch movies snuggled on my couch or making dinner with roomies. i will look through your medicine cabinet. i'm a curious person. i'm looking to connect with someone who wants to have an exciting time traveling, dancing and having fun together, who's as terrified about getting close as i am but wants to do it anyway. i'm intense and you don't mind.\n",
      "i love spending time in nature--hiking, camping, backpacking, cross country skiing and river kayaking. i've lived and travelled in other countries and am interested in other cultures. i'm looking for a partner who shares my values and some of my interests.  i'm spending as much time as i can playing (hiking, skiing and biking) and traveling and teaching english as a second language to adults. enjoying simple pleasures. my eyes. books-- i love novels by george saunders and harurki murakami. i read a lot of eclectic stuff- short stories in the new yorker, buddhist stuff, carl hiaasen , and the number one ladies detective agency series. right now i'm reading a graphic novel by an iranian woman.  music- bluegrass, jazz, acoustic rock, folk, opera, classical (just about everything but hard rock and rap.)  food- burritos, chocolate, salmon, hummus, yogurt, palak paneer (indian spinach dish), mostly vegetarian friends mountain air hiking skiing laughter music nature and spirituality. going out of town, having dinner with friends or watching a dvd at home. as you'll see by my photos, i seem to enjoy posing with statues.

      "hey. i'm funny, sarcastic, impulsive, and passionate. i appreciate a sense of humor and would gladly make my whole profile a long joke if i knew people would understand it. after taking a hiatus from this site, i'm slowly getting ready to okcupid my face off....too much too soon? currently... self-summarizing in 50 brilliant words. generally trying to seem effortlessly witty and charming -- trying being the operative word. is it working? making people laugh, dancing my way out of a room, breaking and creating awkward moments, cutting the tension in serious situations, dancing to 80's hits and road rage (sometimes a little bit of both at the same time). infectious and genuine laugh. fiction comedies offensive rap/pop and indie electronic everything except watermelon flavoring. 1. down comforters 2. my family 3. my dog 4. it's always sunny in philadelphia 5. friends 6. sunshine (7. inconsistent capitalization) (8. bucking the system. take that okcupid! eight things i couldn't live without!) how rappers determine lyrics/ what it would be like to pop bottles on video hoes. what it would feel like to suddenly have super abilities and how i would use them. out doing hoodrat stuff with my friends aka doing the latarian milton. big ups! i'm allergic to kiwi. also, i once passed out in a haunted house after a man in a goblin costume grabbed my ankle. like me, you find it hard to sit down and write something serious on this. also, if you too \"want to do hoodrat stuff\" -- you, me and my boy latarian can paint the town red.\n",
      "i grew up between america, thailand and taiwan which exposed me to media from all over the world. being a kid in south east asia in the 80s was like having bittorrent before the internet really existed.  i ingested a steady diet of comics, movies, tv shows, music and videogames (and food!) from asia, america and europe. i love it all, from high art to low brow. i find propagating a genuine aesthetic important. now i work at zynga, i have found success in making my passion a career.  grateful for what i've achieved, i'm now enjoying and seeking what more i can do with art. extracting what i find interesting and expressing them visually. i can't stop drawing!!  i can eat anything using chopsticks - including hamburgers and soup (picking up the spoon w. chopsticks!) my face is symmetrical and i'm not white. books: anything nabokov, blood meridian, till we have faces, 9 stories, windup bird chronicle, and lots and lots of comics.  movies: night of the hunter, mindgame, my neighbor totoro, zoolander  shows: venture brothers, 1990's simpsons, anything narrated by david attenborough  music: radiohead, cornelius, elo, blonde redhead, paperdoll, el-p, syd barrett, sopwith camel,  foooooood: toro sashimi, porkbelly ramen, stir fried dou miao, tofu in all its glorious forms. my sketchbooks umami foods comic books music that makes me time-travel pillows colored socks laughing until i cry (sorry this is 7 things, i know) planning future art projects like fun music videos and comics. how my family and friends are doing. enjoying time with friends and family exploring my new city ... one entree at a time. i've been writing poetry since i was a teenager - most recently in a precious little yellow journal. you are passionate about life, food, and art ... love going out and trying new things one day, then staying in and lazing around the next. if you have an opinion about jd salinger or hemmingway as well - that's a plus.\n",
      "living life. and i try not to let it involve too many superficial things. i like nature, road trips, reading, writing, sleeping, and tennis, and sailing. oh, and wine. oh, and music, movies, and sleeping.  i may have mentioned sleeping already. i've always been a rolling stone. starting campfires, reading good books, picking good wine, tennis, road-tripping, and being at legendary parties. how about, \"what's the first thing you usually notice about people?\" intellect. smile. the way an individual strings together words or phrases; i like to see how their language shapes the world they live in. all the greats. shakespeare, dante, tolstoy. hemingway, fitzgerald, cather. dickinson, auden, eliot. and on.  i love good movies. funny movies. movies with plots that make me think. movies with excruciatingly beautiful language, emotions, and relationships. tragedy. people used to say, \"i'm not dramatic.\" too bad, i used to tell them -- for the greeks, \"dran\" (or drama) meant \"movement.\" and like the tree that survives a ferocious storm, you need to move to live.  all music is pretty much sublime. (no, not the band. but i like them too.)  i especially like: jimi hendrix, nick drake, elliott smith, jeff buckley, the allman brothers, bob dylan, eric clapton, etc etc etc. sunlight, love, friends, family, water, literature. rocking out, road trips with friends or alone, starry nights on top of mountains, poems, wine, music, and the company of my thoughts. the only thing typical about a friday night, is that it has a vista of possibilities. ask me over a glass of wine or beer. if you're smart, interesting, and fun. life is too short to not be all of those.  and kindness. this is a must. i have low tolerance (surprising for me, because i try to be open-minded) for unkind individuals. be truly nice, and love will give you everything you need.\n",

      "i like residing somewhere between a grin and eye-watering laughter.  to sum up my life, a rather mainstream life, the first third would yield nothing earth-shaking. i pulled the usual things together. education . business. play. travel. answering, finally, the sound of the biological alarm clock which heralded in, at the same time, a mate. it amounted to a wonderful time. i learned a lot.  in the second third of my life i spent most of my time raising two incredible kids. it was fabulous. i learned even more.  now, in what i perceive as the beginning of the last third of my life, and yes, i will live that long, i am continuing to have a good time of it, evolving, re-inventing and discovering all that is new.  ideally, i'd like to share the journey of this last chapter. writing my own act three. it's essentially the story of an imperfect person whose life is continuing to unfold in a most perfect way.  san francisco born and raised, i'm just now settling back into the bay area. i lived in boulder, colorado for many years and raised my family there. my children are \"launched.\" they are decent, directed, capable and compassionate individuals and i don't mind taking some credit for that. they are my gift to the world. i've done my job. it's my turn now.  every day i say how wonderful it is to be \"home.\" it seems as though all the world is new.  i'm enjoying reconnecting with family and old friends. i've been blessed with a lot of love in my life. i'm also making new friends and feel that what i have to give just keeps expanding.  i work. i'm good at my job and it gives me satisfaction. i meet incredible people every day. i learn something every day.  i play. we live in a beautiful, interesting place. there are so many outrageous things to explore and simple things to enjoy. it's exhilarating when wind takes the sails. i love being out on our beautiful bay.  i'd like someone to come out and play with me. being a good friend. being a mom. putting people at ease communicating. committing to do whatever it is i'm doing as well as i can. my job. making pictures, massage, cooking, skiing (i'm actually very good), dancing (no, i don't tango), finding the perfect parking place (i am, indeed, one of those), swinging a golf club. oh, wait, really good at it? maybe not the golf! my smile -- that's what i've been told. books: pride and prejudice. gone with the wind. to kill a mockingbird. i just read troost's travel books and laughed so much; he's funnier than bryson. i've read lots of michener and always liked him and his strong female characters and yes, i was always sorry when they finally ended. a prayer for owen meaney is still on the shelf. the kitchen god's wife. broken for you -- and like this, anything that can make me laugh and cry in the same chapter.  movies: dances with wolves, out of africa, shakespeare in love, you've got mail, moonstruck, love actually and a million other mainstream movies. some foreign. most anything historical. some animation. anything with meryl streep or robert downy jr.. yes, i liked star trek and star wars and harry potter, all because they were darned fun.  i like to be entertained by visual art. if it's dark or deep, i most likely will appreciate it more if it comes out of a book.  music: a bit of everything. rock concerts or the symphony. everything from beatles to beethoven on my ipod. some opera and yes, even some crossover country. i dance hula and, therefore, enjoy some (not all) hawaiian music.  food - healthy. good food, fine wine. my own cooking. no fast food. i love to dine out but my favorite is cooking with a friend or friends. the people i cherish in my life -- my kids, extended family, my female friends. laughter. beautiful natural surroundings. morning coffee -- strong with real cream. forgiveness. floss. how grateful i am for the simple joys that make my day. there's always something!  the japanese proverb: we are all fools whether we dance or not so, we may as well dance. ......game for anything but happiest just relaxing with a friend or friends. you'll find out when you ask and when the time is right. you can invite trust into the room but that doesn't mean it shows up right away. any of the above or any of the following rings true: -- you'd like to spend time with a woman who is genuine, generous and easy to be with. -- you like long walks or a hike in or to a beautiful place. -- you believe your dog can do no wrong. -- you laugh easily. -- you crave the ocean and the mountains -- you are a good kisser.\n",

      "i moved to san francisco from manhattan (school at columbia and then worked for a few years afterward) a year and a half ago, leaving the finance world for the tech world, and i'm absolutely loving it out here -- being around energized and innovative people is simply amazing. the 4 months straight of no rain and having winter only when you choose it (i.e. \"let's go to tahoe this weekend!\") both help the cause. the hard part is being so far from my family, but it seems to be working out just fine.  you - the most important thing for me is that you're not afraid to go after what you want out of life. life can be amazing but is definitely short; so if you're not happy with it, then change it! if you share this philosophy, we'll probably get along well. a love of doing handstands in random places will go a long way, too. i work for a tech company in palo alto (but live in sf). i love my job and the people i get to spend my day with. apart from that, i do yoga almost everyday (i plan to have my own yoga empire someday, which i realize doesn't sound very yogic, but whatever...) and pretty much never stop dancing. i got a ski share in tahoe this winter with a group of friends; so i'll be making good use of that! i learned how to surf last winter in costa rica and love it...but the water is just too cold for me here--hawaii anyone? i'm pretty athletic, but it tends to come in the form of acrobatic capabilities (not so much on the hand-eye coordination...except for tennis). i'm also pretty good at seeing the good side of most situations and people. my ceo said to me, \"how is it possible that your hair and your personality match so well?\" so the answer is definitely my hair. unless it's in yoga--then it's my backbends. i love going to concerts in this city! treasure island, outside lands, or just going to popscene to check out up and coming performers for $10. i love any music you can dance to...but i will also dance to pretty much anything (so i guess i'm just not that picky!). to make a list of some of my favs to listen to: little dragon, lykke li, cut copy, the smiths, the cure, hot chip, mark ronson, and pretty much everything from the 90s radio hits genre.  music styles to dance to - top 40, hiphop, salsa, samba, house, but i reserve dancing to dubstep for burning man only (otherwise really not my cup of tea)  books: atlas shrugged, the china study, cien anos de soledad, wuthering heights to name a few. currently reading the glass castle--very good! i read a lot because i have a daily train ride (and my company got everyone kindles for christmas).  as for food/restaurants, i'm a vegan and i actually like what i eat (and don't miss what i don't) because it just makes me feel great--millennium and uva enoteca are probably 2 of my favorite restaurants here in sf, but i can make a vegan meal for myself at pretty much any restaurant (so i'm rarely the one who vetoes a restaurant!). 1) my family 2) my friends 3) yoga 4) hair conditioner 5) sunshine 6) spinach :) what my next steps in my life will be. i'm not stressing about it--i just like being proactive about my life. spending time with friends. or something else. i'm a libertarian ...if you think we'll laugh a lot together!\n",

      "my day job keeps me inside, but i wish were outside more of the time. my favorite activities are reading, cooking, hiking & bicycling, especially mountain biking. i'm happiest when i'm off backpacking and climbing in the sierras or in the deserts of utah & nevada. maybe someday i'll take my interest in gardening to the next level and become a small-scale farmer. i love to swim in clean, cold freshwater lakes. i've tried making my own sauerkraut (pleasantly surprised at the results, and how easy it is to make). sometime i'd like to make wine.  i'm native to northern california and live in san francisco now. i love the city and its energy, my neighborhood, the random people i meet on muni, riding caltrain to work.  i am thoughtful, cynical, and lazy. working at a software company. experimenting with photography. enjoying the city, but trying to get into the mountains as often as practical. the things that i love to do. especially following a trail over partly snow-covered ground. my lopsided grin, my flashing green eyes, and my height. books: douglas adams' hitchhikers trilogy. hemingway, esp the sun also rises & a farewell to arms. edward abbey. gary snyder. wh auden. the poisonwood bible. dr. zhivago. lately i've been reading wilfred thesiger's account of travelling with the bedouin in the 1940s.  movies: woody allen's work, esp annie hall, manhattan, celebrity, vicky christina barcelona. casablanca. the graduate. antonioni's movies, especially blow up & l'avventura.  music: the velvet underground. modest mouse. cat power. mark knopfler. sleater kinney. the black keys. the strokes. metric. deer tick.  food: split pea soup in front of the fireplace. curries. summertime pesto. fresh baked bread. quinoa. goat. these are my favorite things to have with me: (1) something to read, (2) a bicycle, (3) a nearby farmers' market, (4) a camera, (5) a laptop, (6) water bottle.  but if i were somewhere remote, i might not need most of these things. i'm trying to understand how i relate to things, to tools, to art. having versus being. also, where words come from & what they really mean. where i want to travel next. the nature of friendships. cooking dinner. or at the climbing gym. or going out for beers. i wish to be an inspector of volcanoes. that's from something edward abbey wrote. seriously though, logging into this site is pretty weird for me. i am really good at telling all kinds of private things to perfect strangers, but i can't think of anything i'd like to write here. you love the sticky slickness of seawater against your skin.\n",
      "well, what can i say. i like to be very active. i love the outdoors. i love to play games and i am not afraid to get dirty. camping and road trips are two of my favorite things. i am currently a teacher.  i am ambitious, outgoing, and active.  i will be moving to san francisco in june so sorry about the \"current location\". it will be happening. right now i guess i am just trying to network.  i love talking to all different types of people so if you enjoy a good conversation, hit me up! i studied drama education at the ohio state university. i currently own a children's theatre company i started with my business partner in central ohio. being a full-time student and running a business was no easy task but i managed. now i am in arkansas teaching high school math...a weird switch but i love what i do : )  next year i will be teaching theater in san fran, so i am super excited about the transition! i am really good at organizing? haha, i like to plan things out i guess. i don't know though...i am sure different people notice different things. if you looked at me, you'd see a face with two eyes a nose and a mouth....you can look at my pictures if that's what you want to know. let me know what you notice first.  i just recently found out i have catch phrases...like, \"ook\" to the tune of a sarcastic sentence and also, \"i was like..what!?\" while laughing on the \"what\"...i guess it's kind of hard to explain so if you ever have a conversation with me, watch out for these; i'm sure they will happen. i love anything written by david sedaris! i currently have a stack of books next to my bed that i have either started and i'm half way finished, or i will be starting. i recently read the hunger games to see what my students found to be so interesting...and i'm hooked! when i was little, i loved the i spy books. those pictures could keep my attention for hours because there was so much to look at!  i like a lot of different kinds of movies, it just depends on my mood. i'll admit, anything from pixar is pretty ok in my book. my favorite movie of all time is big fish. i also watch a ton of documentaries thanks for the ease of use of netflix.  i love pretty much all foods. i could eat sushi the rest of my life and be happy. fast food is something i try to stay away from, but i frequent these establishments when necessary. this would probably be easier, here is a list of foods i am not thrilled by: ~raw onion ~black olives i'll be honest...i thought the list would be longer...i'll add to it when i think of others. i just went to the store and was craving the strawberry honey bunches of oats cereal. i forgot how much i really do enjoy cereal. it's the perfect meal and snack at any time in the day. umm... water, food, friends, family, animals, outdoors? my future, it is important to me. recently, i am always thinking about lesson plans for the next days. i also spend lots of time trying to figure out what exactly makes me happy. over the past two years, mindsets have been slowly changing so i am still kind of figuring it all out. it depends. out with friends, drinking, playing games...new to the list is sitting on the front porch and having jam session with the neighbors who all have some sort of musical talent. oh, or swimming in the lake (i live on a lake)...the last three things came with the move here to arkansas. ok, so i enjoy puzzling...and if you are thinking to yourself that sounds stupid, you just have never opened a vintage puzzle, sat down with a friend or two, put on some music and just relaxed while creating a wonderful picture...and if it still sounds stupid...that's why it is a private thing. haha  after further review...i have not puzzled in over a year and i thought i should let you know. i will say i probably have more private things to admit...but i need to think of a good one i guess. you are interested? haha but just know that, \"was up?\" and \"how are you?\" are not very good conversation starters for a message. they'll do for an im...but i still think there are better questions/comments you could start with.\n",
      "i'm generally a happy person. confident and optimistic, independent and self-reliant, compassionate, comfortable but always striving to improve. i really love to laugh and kid around, but i also thrive in serious situations. i stay calm and don't get easily flustered, but love to let it loose. tcb. i have a lot of goals for 2012.  i love learning. now i'm learning more about nutrition, fitness, and astronomy.  scuba. i only got to go a couple times last year, but am looking forward to some great underwater adventures this year. i just bought a plane ticket to belize!  i'm always trying to be fully aware and alive. i enjoy my work and being with my friends, exploring the world and experiencing new things. my life keeps getting better and more fun, and i'm grateful for it. learning new things. my eyes, my smile, and that i am light-hearted. although i have had two friends tell me lately that i look \"intense\" since i just cut my hair pretty short. i do read books. but i suffer from book amnesia. it's a serious illness that makes me forget books after i've read them. one that i have not forgotten is siddhartha. that one stuck with me. i recently read \"the power of habit\" and still do remember it!  gone with the wind, casablanca, lawrence of arabia, the big lebowski, groundhog day, caddyshack, the unbearable lightness of being, fast times at ridgemont high, soapdish, drowning mona, star wars. those are my classics. but i generally like comedies. have you seen tropic thunder? undercover brother?  current tv: 30 rock, the office, modern family, the new girl classic tv: seinfeld, arrested development  yes, i do like football, but usually only watch the 49ers.  huge range of music... shall i bore you? the beatles, the rolling stones, bob marley, the grateful dead, tom waites, talking heads, sublime, weezer, flaming lips, the police, rush, run dmc, a tribe called quest, de la soul. so many more, but those are my classics that come to mind. i do like a lot of newer music too. i go to the noisepop festival and treasure island music festival to see some great ones. i've been distracted by jazz lately. there's just so much good stuff out there. i love hearing international music that i don't hear often.  cheese. mmmm. cheese.... it's so weird but so good! fried cheese. mmmm.  i think good food of any cuisine is good food. i love trying new things... especially when i've never heard of it before. there's this little japanese restaurant called kiss where i go and order whatever the chef wants to make me. i hardly ever know exactly what i'm eating (beyond his explanation of \"vegetable\" or \"fish\"), but i love it. - my friends, - teachers, - the internets, - my conscience, - my friend's little 2-year old. (even though he's two) - sunshine mostly i think about things that make me laugh and smile. i think about funny things, time spent with friends, things that i am happy that i learned, and things that i am grateful for. and i try to pay close attention to whatever (or whomever) i am looking at. why isn't that as easy as it sounds?  i love thinking about how all of us and everything we know came from the same stuff: star-stuff (as carl sagan said). reality is so weird.  how to achieve my goals and help people at the same time.  travelling. past travels and future travels. my mind expands when i travel. i don't quite understand it, but i like it. meeting friends or hanging out at home relaxing. usually it involves a few drinks and music. sometimes just music, sometimes just drinks, sometimes cooking. sometimes a road-trip drive, without the drinks but with the music. typical involves those things. i love the feeling of coming back from a long walk in the rain and stripping off my wet clothes. you are generally happy, sweet, thoughtful, confident with yourself, fun, feminine, and spontaneous without being too flighty.\n",

      "hey guys,  single and mingling, seeing whats out there, kissing a lot of frogs to find my prince.  i am a professional makeup artist, esthetician with my own business. i am also an actor, singer and entertainer.  i'm very friendly, hard working guy who likes to balance it all with good times with friends, getting stoned and relaxing. i enjoy the occasional beer bust, but prefer the bars on the less crowded days. i enjoy all of the arts and can be a bit of a foodie, but also like trashy movies and junk food.  i try to make it to the gym at least three times per week, but with my hectic schedule and love of sleep that doesn't always happen.  i'm 35, a leo, 6'1\", 270, hair color varies, baby blues, beard, tattooed and pierced and have a furry body.  i'm very sensual, versatile, love making out. if you like to massage, this big kitty loves to be pet and rubbed. i may even roll on my back so you could rub my belly.  i'm definitely into meeting people for friends and dates but eventually want to find the man i will spend my life with. ...beautifying the world one person at a time ...entertaining others through laughter, song and story ...conquering fears and changing perspective ...bettering the world by bettering myself  all of that in mind, i have been working on myself for the past few years. this includes cognitive therapy, meditation, working out, eating better and changing my perspective of the world, the people in it and my interaction with them. seeing the world in a different way feels sort of like the matrix. you finally see your reality for what it is and can never go back to the way it was. you just need to learn how to live in this new environment and mindset. i find it all worth it in the end. i'm finally becoming who i've always seen myself to be. makeup artistry, skin care, acting, singing, laughing,kissing, loving, being a good friend, listening, healing energy, sex, wrapping presents, crafts, talking, paper mache what i hear most is that people are amazed by my piercing blue eyes. i thank my grandmother eva for that. i was named for her and also have her eyes. i enjoy having fun with my hair cut and color and have been known to sport a colorful mohawk, shave my head and everything in between. i've been having fun with my beard lately as well. its the longest its been ever and i get lots of compliments on it. and those chasers out there, love my belly. i'm working on diminishing it, but while its there, this buddha belly loves belly rubs. books: anything by armistead maupin. i really love tales of the city. i sometimes feel like my life in sf is much like a character in one of the books. gregory mcguire not only wrote wicked and son of a witch, but he also wrote confessions of and ugly stepsister and others. movies: drop dead gorgeous my favorite comedy, half baked a great stoner flick, the notebook my favorite romantic movie, terms of endearment all i gotta say is \"she needs her pills!\", pricilla queen of the desert god save the queens! music: classic rock, pop, musical theater, blues and torch songs food: crispy, tasty, fatty, bready, cheesy, carbs, mexitalianese water air food sex laughter pot my place in the universe, who i was and who i'm becoming  i have been studying eastern philosophy, especially buddhism and the law of attraction and find them both intriguing and truthful. i hope to master the techniques in both practices. relaxing at home catching up on dvr tv, or perhaps out with friends at the lonestar saloon. my work week isn't traditional, so friday is usually the middle of my week and so i don't have a lot of late friday nights i'm not very private and admit to most anything you find me interesting and stimulating in any way\n",

      "i'm an optimistic person who tends to see (maybe even to bring out) the best in other people. i'm an unrepentant child of the 60's -- i haven't given up the quest for connection and meaning that marked the positive side of the \"counterculture.\"  some single people think of themselves as half a person, looking to find their other half so that they can be made whole. i don't feel that way. i consider myself a complete person, content with my life, yet i'm eager to share experiences, joys, and maybe even some challenges. i'm in-house counsel for a large computer company, and i have two wonderful kids, both in college. i love my work and my family. i have relatively little drama in my life, and i like it that way. (i hope you don't think that this makes me boring!) i'm a few years away from what my parents' generation called \"retirement,\" and i'm beginning to think about what the next phase will look like. i'm convinced that it will be thrilling and rewarding. making people feel comfortable. i'm inquisitive and thoughtful, and i love it when someone is willing to engage with me on a deep/caring level. my smile and my warmth. i find it easy to empathize with people, and i think most people \"get\" that right away. i'm an \"adventurous eater\" -- i enjoy eating food from around the world, especially if it's spicy and/or unusual. i'm learning to cook, and i'd love to spend time with a woman who's a few steps ahead of me on this path. my tastes in books/movies/shows etc. are quite diverse; let's talk. i've been thinking about this question for a long time. other than my family, my health, and a decent level of financial security, i can't think of things i can't live without. there are many things that i treasure, but my basic needs are really simple. how lucky i am. here's a tagline i made up: \"on any given day, if you're not feeling grateful, you're just not paying attention.\" i like that. if i'm not out with you, i'm probably home catching up on tv shows i recorded but didn't have time to watch during the week. i need my weekly hit of bill maher, jon stewart, whitney, and (before the season ended) louie. some friday nights i'm having dinner with a friend, or i'm out at a music concert, either by myself or with a friend. although i'm very confident and outspoken in my professional life, i find it utterly intimidating to initiate a conversation with an attractive woman. any of what i said above struck a chord with you, and you're interested in finding out whether there's chemistry between us.\n",

      "libacious. complicated, in a good way. lover of food, people, music, laughter. devourer of information. tinkerer.  and a little cynical about the viability of this okc experiment. looking forward to being convinced otherwise. professionally, i research and write about data*. but i also spend part of my day as a business wonk. apparently, this requires a rather unusual combination of skills.  i'm fascinated with all things anthropological (from genetics to social organization to technological interaction) and sometimes dream of going for a graduate degree in hci.  i spend a lot of my free time chasing knowledge, and learning how to do things that i don't know anything about. current projects include building a sous vide cooker, making fennel tonic, and learning to bezel set an adorable watch mechanism i found to make a ring.  *yes, my work really is that meta. lots of things: making cocktails, cooking, throwing a mean party, learning languages, being empathetic, problem solving, putting words together in interesting ways, photography, and using data.  i'm super great at getting projects to the 90% mark. you know the rest.  i'm not good at remembering and telling jokes. i also suck at figuring out how mechanical things work. my smile (how twee is that?). but if i'm walking my dog, they usually notice him first. books: 1984 brave new world handmaid's tale the awakening bright lights, big city high fidelity the great gatsby american gods fight club blink (i find gladwell entertaining. but don't call him a scientist.) guns, germs & steel (i'm halfway through, but i already know it will be a favorite)  my daily information diet includes the economist, newsweek, the week (when i'm being lazy), ted, pitchfork, flowingdata and wired.  movies: the princess bride in bruges helvetica exit through the gift shop fight club sexy beast the usual suspects all the president's men code 46 coen bros (most anything) casablanca (especially when it plays at the paramount) cave of forgotten dreams  tv (via hulu or netflix these days): mad men fringe the west wing arrested development californication twin peaks  music: the only things i don't like are hardcore rap, country and metal. i'm a sucker for catchy basslines and complex harmonies, especially when there's something electronic happening, too.  shows i've seen in the last year include: yeasayer, !!!, dale earnhardt jr jr, cut copy, two door cinema club, ed sharpe & magnetic zeros, sleigh bells, neon indian, sister crayon, girl talk, tv on the radio, geographer, lcd soundsystem, caribou, gotan project, panda bear.  i wish cocteau twins would tour again. the internets music my friends projects friday nights my passport the next stage of my life. how lucky i am to live where i do. how amazing my friends are. where i might travel next.  technology. how it's changing us. how we're changing it.  and sex. i admit it. out with friends, cocktail in hand, listening to music, eating something delicious. it wouldn't be very private if i admitted it here, now would it? i've put my dance card on hiatus at the moment, but if you're looking for friendship or a concert buddy, please feel free to drop me a line.\n",
      "i am a single, well educated, young professional, who is seeking a fun, compassionate and exciting person who loves to travel, laugh, and relax on the beach with a great smile.  i just moved to san francisco and would love to meet someone who can show me around! i am a big foodie and am always willing to try anything! i am currently working in it, but someday would love to start my own company. as lame as this sounds, i am really good at making the best chow mein. i pack that sucker with bbq pork, chicken, shrimp, squid, and everything you can think of. at first, i may seem shy but once you get to know me, i really open up to people. it may take a few nudges, but be persistent and i'll show you my outgoing side. i am currently reading \"moonwalking with einstein\" by joshua foer. however, i've been starting to read the chronicle often an am also subscribed to time magazine. shawshank redemption has always been a classic for me. music of all kinds are appreciated, especially but not excluded to english rock, such as the beetles. my watch, iphone, wallet, hair gel, a good pair of jeans and clean underwear. my friends, family and people who change the world. usually watching a movie i downloaded, while wearing pj's and eating takeout. i enjoy chick flicks. you feel that i am a great match and if you're looking to meet someone new and friendly. :)\n",
      "i think that honesty and intelligence are hot.  i love learning new things. i work as an attorney with a federal agency (my job is telling people they don't get government money). i like being a lawyer because each day brings me interesting things to think about.  when i'm not working, i'm probably cooking. i like cooking because each meal lets me be creative.  i was in rural idaho recently for my grandmother's funeral, and as we started cleaning out the house i persuaded my family to compost the unusable food and drive the recyclables 3 hours (on the way home) to recycling facilities. it made me feel like a californian. cooking. my mom started me cooking family dinner once a week when i was about 12, and that lasted until i got my first job at 17. cooking for the family made me really comfortable cooking for other people. so, once i know you're not crazy, i'll probably offer to cook for you.  when cooking, i don't use recipes but like throwing things together to see how they work out. examples: bulghur, pomegranate, and arugula salad, with olive oil and verjus; vegan french onion soup with fennel; miso with kale instead of wakame. at the request of several friends for my cooking ideas, i've recently started posting them at scottjb.wordpress.com.  because i'm comfortable in the kitchen, i have a hard time going out to restaurants by myself and usually only go to restaurants on dates or with friends. that means you can suggest a place, and as long as it has good veggie options, i'll probably be game.  learning. i love learning new things. i can spend hours going through a wikipedia page and following as many links as possible. i think being able to borrow ebooks from the library is one of the best things about owning a smartphone (or the nook i bought myself as a christmas present).  i'm also good at legalese (is that a good thing?). alas, it's not an available language option. how cold my hands are. i like to hope the saying \"cold hands, warm heart\" is true.  i am interested in what okcupid says i am like (in the similar uses section there's a note that says more adventurous or attentive or whatever). i haven't figured out how to see these for myself, so feel free to let me know what it thinks of me. i also like checking out people that the system says aren't good matches, to see if i can figure out why. reading. i mostly read non-fiction. i like the economist and read it every week. i recently finished the better angels of our nature by steven pinker; it is long and complex, but consistently intriguing and i highly recommend it. other recent reads include a queer history of the united states by michael bronski, and debt by david graeber. both are good (but better angels was better).in the last month i read, and really enjoyed, now you see it. it also made me interested in neuroplasticity, so i've been hunting books on that topic.  movies. i don't watch many movies, but have a soft spot for studio ghibli (i was living in japan when mononoke hime came out). i enjoy watching all 6 hours of angels in america in one viewing (i identify with joe pitt ...).  shows. i don't own a tv but like streaming hulu. i watch castle, psych, burn notice, and the daily show. there's nothing that i'm dedicated to following though.  music. i'm a total ludovico einaudi fan: i've seen him every time he's been to california and have plans to continue seeing him whenever he tours the state. if you don't know who he is, look him up. otherwise, i'm pretty eclectic and like nearly everything. for a long time i would have said no rap, but pandora has some good rap songs in my exercise station.  food. i've been vegetarian for about four years now. (i don't mind if dates order meat but appreciate it if you don't pester me about not eating meat). i love good chocolate. i also really like tea. i tend to like a complex oolong like iron goddess (or whatever fun thing i find at aroma) or a japanese green. 1) interesting things to do at work. i'm much happier busy than bored.  2) game night with my parents. i've played games with my parents nearly every sunday since i was in middle school - and still try and do it now via the internet. i have a great relationship with both my parents (siblings too, actually).  3) quality chocolate. my great grandmother (great great) had a rule that when you were craving a snack, you have a little of the best chocolate you can find because it will satisfy you more than a whole bar of mediocre stuff. this is a timeless rule.  4) rainy days and fog. i love watching clouds. there's something magical about watching sunlight break through the clouds.  5) my phone (android). i'm sad to admit it, but i really like the device. after reading \"now you see it\" and thinking about attention, i'm trying an experiment at work where i only look at personal email or internet using the phone. making myself switch to a different device has helped me realize, and bring intentionality, back to my time usage.  6) kissing. i particularly like it when a good kiss makes me forget where i am. whatever i've been reading lately. or work. or cute guys. (probably all of these, actually).  cooking, reading, or playing a game. if i'm lucky, a date. if i'm particularly unlucky, at work. i love the webcomics order of the stick and sinfest.  i'm not sure how private it is (because i'd tell you pretty early on), but perhaps as a screening device: i grew up mormon (officially resigned) and while i have some delightful religious family and friends (my immediate family is amazing), i dislike organized religion. i'm not necessarily opposed to dating someone with spiritual or religious feelings, but if religion is an important part of your life, we likely will not be a good match. before coming out, i went on a mission to kobe, japan. even though i no longer believe in religion, i'm immensely grateful for the opportunity to go to japan and have an immersive experience in another culture. i also married, and divorced, a very nice woman (see, i said i identify with joe pitt). i am indescribably happier being out, and at the same time i appreciate all that i learned during that part of my life. if that history freaks you out, better to have it out in the open early. but it also means i'm not going to judge you if you have an interesting history too (i may even prefer an interesting history because we'll have things to talk about). besides, while the past informs who we are, the future is still full of potential. you want to get together for tea or dinner or some other in-person conversation. that's why we're here, right?  for potential romantic partners, i generally prefer guys 6 years +/- my age. for friends or scrabble buddies, all ages welcome. other than that, i have no type and like people from all backgrounds.\n",

(thanks lil' bro for that description) i'm very practical, imaginative, and constantly amazed by what's happening around me. i like to go on long trail runs and if i fall, will get back up and keep going (unless something's broken, then we'll see). i don't like machoism, agendas, or fretting. i like to be prepared for any situation anywhere. when i travel, i plan just enough to not be a burden and when i show up, i ask locals what they think i should see. i believe in personal action above all else and i love being around people who are comfortable being themselves. diversity is beautiful. being the change ... we live in the world we create and we can only truly control what we do as individuals ... turning dreams into realities my smile and excellent posture :-) thought- and discussion-provoking works i love music i love food ... nothing from a package and i avoid animals clean air, clean water, fresh food, an open-minded society, freedom to express myself, my mind what i can do to make things better and where i should go to do them anywhere i want to be (which is usually home) privacy is relative and i'm a very open person... ...the mood strikes you...  you should not message me if  ...you're just in the mood for sex...\n",

      "i secretly harbor ambitions to be a shark. a shark supermodel. who moonlights as a 20s style detective. i love language. it's one of the few things in the world that i'm passionate about. i will correct your grammar. i'm sorry. that's just the way it is. *addendum* i've been falling down on the grammar job lately. it's slipping away from me, but grocers' apostrophes still make me hulk out. and by hulk out, i mean white out. with my fist.  i put important things in caps! to let people know that i'm yelling the word...  i'm a giant nerd. i am obssessed with doctor who. i pretty much love any show that comes on bbc. one of my goals in life is to find a british person and have them read all 7 harry potter books to me. this fictional british person may or may not be chained to my room. that depends entirely on them. thinking about what i'm going to make for dinner, and how to get to the places i wanna go with no sense of direction. the answer is zig zagily. picking out a good diamond?  making words say things with stuff.  organizing things.  fooooood. someone recently asked me what kind of food i had mastered. i answered, \"food.\" my obnoxious laugh my hair. it changes color often. i'm pretty damn tall. for a girl, that is. books: anything by ray bradbury, kurt vonnegut, or tolkien. i went through a jane austen phase. harry potter music: i'll listen to just about anything. especially if i can sing along. tv: i like nerdy british comedies and american cartoons i.e. dr. who and the venture bros. *if you have a way to watch the new dr. who season, i'll love you forever.* food: i'll eat just about anything too. i recently learned that i'm not a fan of beets. i love cheeeeeeese. sometimes i go to whole foods and just wander around the cheese section staring fondly at various cheeses as if they were my children. delicious, delicious children. cell phone- i know it seems shallow, but really, my phone does everything! it even cooks me dinner. okay, that's a lie. my phone is just a phone, but being a child of the 21st century, i can't imagine what i'd do without it.  showers- i shower twice a day. sometimes more. i hate the idea that i smell bad. i usually don't, but i think i do.  sweet tea- i have an addiction. there's a high probability that i have diabetes because of it, but i don't care. eventually i would like all of my blood to be replaced by it.  good cookware. i want everything to be as non-stick as possible.  that's all i've got for now. how i can make more money with which to buy more food. whether or not that thing you said/wrote is grammatically correct. getting my drink on! quietly. alone. in my room. or working. when i say it like that, i don't sound very interesting, do i?  let's try again. i'm battling evil giant space crocodile robots! think up something private and pretend i've done it. then message me and tell me about it.  that picture of me is like, 5 years old, but i don't own a camera, and my cameraphone takes pictures that are about 1 cm x 1cm and have no detail at all. another thing: apparently i can't do math. i have no idea how old that picture actually is. 4. 4 years. 12? you have the money to get those pictures back. you know the ones.\n",
      "i'm a storyteller. these days that translates to novelist and short storywriter, and singer/songwriter.  i'm a curious spirit that never really fit in with any single group - so i have many. i strive to discover the lands and lives around me, looking for the odd kindred spirit.  i'm self-confident, yet easygoing and definitely open minded, with the insatiable curiosity to try everything - so my experiences and friends and loves are as varied as can be.  i divide my time between exploring, adventuring and traveling out in the world, or relaxing at home, gardening, devouring books, and telling stories. i play at being an extrovert in public but my true nature is creative solitude. my dream home is a rural paradise just minutes away from the bustle of a big city downtown (pretty close to the life i live, and something i am busy making even more of a reality). i'm not contradictory - i'm just not very conventional.  if you find we have much in common, feel free to say hi. i'm in a great relationship that i am whole-heartedly devoted to. i'm just as devoted to my writing. i consider myself lucky to be making a living from it. much of my time is spent writing and reading amidst a vast library of books.  my wanderlust gets me out the door and all over the world for months at a time. i am an explorer of three continents and twenty countries so far: thailand, cambodia, vietnam, laos, brazil, argentina, uruguay, chile, bolivia, peru, ecuador, columbia, panama, costa rica, nicaragua, honduras, el salvadore, mexico, canada, and our own usa.  i often say burning man is my favorite foreign country because it's so wild and unlike any culture on earth. you will often find me there celebrating life and contemplating the new year. let me know if you plan on being on the playa! writing. probably the long dark hair. i'd neither expect nor want total cross-over in these things. i enjoy cross-pollination. ;)  (a) a good man is hard to find, by flannary o'connor; lolita, by vladimir nabokov; to kill a mockingbird, by harper lee; the talisman, by stephen king and peter straub; deathbird stories, by harlan ellison; fear and loathing in las vegas, by hunter s. thompson; lizard music by d. manus pinkwater; the time traveler's wife, by audrey niffennegger; neverwhere, by neil gaiman; stories, by t.c. boyle; taltos, by steven brust; fight club, by chuck palahniuk; one hundred years of solitude, by gabriel garcia marquez; down and out in the magic kingdom, by cory doctorow; accelerando by charles stross... way too much to list here. reading is part of my vocation - i read constantly.

(d) every strange and wonderful cuisine of the world. my favorites are mexican, italian, argentinian, indian, thai, vietnamese, brazilian. peruvian, hawaiian, ethiopian, korean, and japanese. many of these i have eaten in their home countries. i chase good food trucks like a rabid dog.  i love food so much i trained as a chef, and though i don't cook professionally anymore, i still light the stove burner daily. travel - the outer world through which i explore myself in relationship to others.  writing/reading - the inner world through which i express all that i have known.  friends - being up to no good in favorable numbers ;)  intimacy - the realm of true connection; intimacy is my favorite space.  food - the divine state of flavor, richness and spice. the tart of wine, and the sweet savor of eating dessert first.  nature - wolves, wilderness, and other wild things through which i realize my own nature. activism, adventure, aikido, alternative lifestyles, androgyny, animal spirits, astrophysics, authors, backpacking, bare feet, bdsm, belly buttons, bisexuality, books, buddism,burning man, camping, cats, children, cobb houses, conversation, cooking, cuddling, dance, dogs, earth, environment, erotica, exploration, family, finance, flirting, freedom, friends, gardening, guitar, hiking, hugs, intellect, intimacy, journeying, kids, kissing, learning, long hair, love, meditation, meeting new people, mountain biking, music, musicians, mythology, naked, native american, nature, novelist, open relationships, pansexuality, passion, permaculture, poly, polyamory, quantum physics, queer, reading, road trips, sensuality, sex, shamanism, simple living, singing, snuggling, songwriting, spirituality, stories, sushi, thunderstorms, totem animals, touching, travel, writing... a) holed up in creative space, writing something new. b) out having an adventure. you'll just have to ask me in private. ;) you are looking for an unusual friend. you take the path less travelled and are searching for a little adventure.  i just moved close to the city and now work in the heart of it. i'd like to make new friends and plug into communities - writers and artists, open/poly, bdsm, queer...  i'm not here looking for the hookup. neither am i looking for major relationships. i'm not even looking for a date. let's start with friendship and see where that takes us.\n",

      "i'm an \"undercover geek\". at first glance i might appear to be a well dressed, happening, intelligent, active young man with a successful career who goes to rock shows, surfs, and is generally out and about having a great time.  however i also love sci fi and anime, play video games (since i was a wee lad) and board games (more recently), and maybe get a little too excited about zombies and halloween. i tend to have silly ideas and then run with them, and often do ridiculous things just for the sake of it.  people sometimes call me a hipster, but hey i was into calling people hipster back before it was cool, ok! i wear ironic clothing, but never clothing ironically. trying to enjoy life as much and as often as possible. current methods include; surfing, hiking, running, wine tasting, dancing, going to rock shows, enjoying themed parties with my friends, exploring the food in the mission, and lounging in the park (dolores or gg).  i just gave my life a reboot by moving to san francisco and quitting my mountain view job, so i've taken some time off to explore the city and determine my next move.  ultimately i'm on the lookout for that special someone to move on to the next phase of life with. i guess you could call that \"settling down\", but there's still plenty of adventures to have. taking too long to get dressed before a night out, (alternately) getting ready in a hurry, running my ass off (full marathon on the horizon), urban hiking, singing in the car, wailing at the audience at karaoke bars, spending too much money on costumes, listening to too much indie rock, dancing like a fool, drumming (or rather pretending to in rock band) unusual facial hair. currently i'm sporting \"friendly muttonchops\", which i grew sort of for the edwardian ball, but decided to continue rocking. my go-to is wicked big sideburns though books: burning chrome, i robot, 1984, world war z, zombie survival guide, enders game, hitchhikers guide movies: inception, scott pilgrim, shawn of the dead, children of men, amelie, nausicaa and any other studio ghibli music: radiohead, metric, arcade fire, the phenomenauts, new pornagraphers, the strokes, 80s butt rock and 80s new wave food: i love it all, especially exotic international cuisine webcomics: penny arcade, xkcd, cat & girl friends family music sunshine & great weather delicious food fun and excitement how to survive the impending zombie apocalypse. how i can make a living messing around with crafts and bizarre mad-science projects. what's over that hill. how that thing over there works. out seeing a local band live at a small venue, or just kicking back a drink with my friends. i once walked 46 miles just to see if i could you like what you see you're interested in meeting in person you have a goofy side that you aren't afraid to embrace or just to prove me wrong when i say that women never message the man first\n",

The KL $f(t)$ is $ t \\text{ log } t $, while the $\\chi^2$ is $t^2-1$. KL comes from information and $\\chi^2$ from measure theory. As such, the KL divergence computes the relative entropy between two distributions--how they differ in bits, while the $\\chi^2$ whether the same statistical inferences can be drawn from them both.  \n",

    "Now we will calculate the KL divergence for each pair of corpora, turn the results into a matrix, and visualize the matrix as a heatmap. Recall that $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q)$ measures the amount of information loss when $Q$ is used to approximate $P$. Here, the rows are the $P$s used for calculating KL divergences, and the columns are the $Q$s. So, each cell measures the amount of information loss when the word distribution of the column text is used to approximate the word distribution of the row text. Because the KL divergence is directional, such that the divergence of $P$ from $Q$ is different from the same of $Q$ from $P$, the matrix is assymetric and contains unique information above and below the diagonal. The same is true for the $\\chi^2$ divergence."
